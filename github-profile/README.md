Hey, I'm WhispersOfJ

Self-hosted media infrastructure, developer tooling, and AI-assisted automation.

🎬 thebearcave
A slim, robust self-hosted media stack — 9 always-on Docker Compose services, one `docker compose up -d`.
Usenet-only acquisition via NzbDAV (no torrents, no debrid), streamed through an rclone FUSE mount into a Plex server with VAAPI hardware transcoding. Slimmed from 29 services down to a deliberately minimal core for stability and headroom; Bazarr re-joined in September 2026.

Prowlarr → Radarr / Sonarr → NzbDAV (Usenet + WebDAV) → rclone FUSE mount → Plex
with Seerr for requests, Bazarr for subtitles, and Unpackerr for automatic extraction.

🛠️ arrfleet-toolkit
Claude Code skills for managing a self-hosted Arr-stack: config sync, TRaSH-Guides profiles, request-manager integration, download-client orchestration, path validation, secrets, health checks, and compose lifecycle.

🧠 Metacacharr (archived)
A metadata cache proxy for Plex — cached TMDB/TVDB lookups, warm-up jobs, image caching, and Prometheus metrics. Retired in the slim-down; kept as reference.

🧰 Operations tooling
The active operational surface is a set of Bash functions: queue management, Plex maintenance (scans, trash, Butler), backlog checks, mount health checks, and a manual, profile-gated ImageMaid cleanup — all validated in CI with ShellCheck, actionlint, and compose tests.
