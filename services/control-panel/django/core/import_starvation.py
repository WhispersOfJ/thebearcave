"""Detects Radarr/Sonarr import starvation - the 2026-08-08 incident where
a mass backfill silently stopped all imports for hours.

Ported from the FastAPI-era control-panel/core/import_starvation.py for the
Django/DRF rewrite. Mechanism, signals, constants (STARVATION_THRESHOLD_SECONDS,
REFRESH_COMMAND, SEARCH_COMMANDS, EVENT_*) and every function name/signature
are byte-identical to the source.

Transforms applied vs. the FastAPI-era source:
1. The module has no FastAPI imports in the original - the only change is
   that require_queue_app() (imported from core.arr_client) raises
   core.api_base.ServiceError instead of a fastapi HTTPException, which
   this module never catches directly, so behavior is unchanged.
2. None - everything else ports verbatim.

Mechanism: RefreshMonitoredDownloads is the single command that both polls
the download client (populating the queue) and triggers imports of completed
items. It runs on a 1-minute schedule but shares a thread pool with searches
and has no priority over them. Queue 1104 MoviesSearch commands and it simply
never gets a slot - radarr's went 85 minutes without starting, sonarr_anime's
146 minutes, while both kept grabbing thousands of releases.

The trap for any health check: because RefreshMonitoredDownloads is what
*populates* the queue, a starved app reports an EMPTY queue. Every
queue-shaped check (trackedDownloadStatus flags, failedPending counts,
importBlocked counts) reads perfectly clean on a totally broken app. That is
exactly how the first sweep of the incident mis-reported all four apps as
healthy. Never infer health from an empty queue alone - ask this module.

Two independent signals, both cheap and deterministic:
  1. A queued RefreshMonitoredDownloads older than STARVATION_THRESHOLD.
     Conclusive on its own - the command is scheduled every 60s, so a
     queued-but-not-started one past the threshold means the pool is full.
  2. last-grab newer than last-import by more than the same threshold.
     Corroborating evidence, and the signal a human actually notices
     ("nothing is showing up in Sonarr").
