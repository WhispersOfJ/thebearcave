# Metacache — Design Document

An ARR-app companion that caches metadata locally so Plex (and the ARR apps) update from
a fast local server instead of hammering external providers.

**Status:** Draft v1 — August 2026
**Language:** C# / .NET (rationale in §9)

---

## 1. TL;DR

The idea — "cache TMDB/TVDB metadata on a local server so Plex refreshes from there" —
is not only feasible, it got *dramatically easier* in December 2025: **Plex added native
support for Custom Metadata Providers** (PMS 1.43+). A provider is just an HTTP API.
You add its URL in Plex (Settings → Metadata Agents → Add Provider), pick it as the
agent for a library, and Plex pulls *all* matching + metadata + artwork from your server.
No DNS hijacking, no MITM, no cert tricks — for Plex.

So the design is one local service with two faces:

1. **Plex face (primary):** a native Plex metadata provider that answers Plex's match and
   metadata requests out of a local cache.
2. **ARR face (in scope):** a caching reverse proxy for the domains Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr
   hit directly (`api.themoviedb.org`, `image.tmdb.org`, `api.thetvdb.com`,
   `webservice.fanart.tv`), reached via a DNS/hosts override. This is the classic
   "cache proxy" pattern, needed only because the ARR apps don't have a pluggable
   metadata backend the way Plex now does.

Everything (provider lookups, proxy fetches) reads/writes the same shared local cache, so
Plex scans, ARR imports, and UI art all hit the LAN instead of the internet.

### Existing work to study first

| Project | What it is | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| `plexinc/tmdb-example-provider` | Official Plex example provider (TypeScript, TV only) | Reference implementation of the provider API — read before writing code |
| `developer.plex.tv/pms` → "Metadata Providers" | Official API docs | The contract (§6) |
| `Drewpeifer/plex-meta-tvdb` | Community TVDB provider (archived) | Second example of the API |
| `daemosofchaos/PlexModernMetadataProvider` | **C#/.NET 10** provider for Plex | Validates C# as a stack; movie matching ideas |
| `Glossarr` | Proxy that intercepts metadata requests for translation | Proof that intercepting ARR/Plex metadata traffic works in practice |

---

## 2. Why do this? (goals)

- **Faster scans/refreshes:** LAN latency (sub-ms) instead of WAN round-trips; repeated
  refreshes of the same item are served from disk without touching the internet.
- **Rate-limit immunity:** TMDB (~50 req/s burst) and TVDB (now paid, rate-limited) stop
  being a bottleneck; a full library refresh becomes a handful of upstream calls.
- **Offline resilience:** metadata and art keep working when the WAN link is down.
- **Determinism:** your metadata no longer changes under you when providers edit records
  or change API behavior; you control TTLs and can pin versions.
- **Privacy:** Plex/ARR no longer phone metadata providers for every item in your library.

Non-goals: not a metadata *editor*, not a replacement for Plex Meta Manager (collections/
overlays), not a piracy-adjacent tool. Movies + TV first; music comes later (Plex hasn't
shipped provider support for music libraries yet).

Data flow for a Plex library refresh: Plex scans files → POSTs a **match** request
(title/year/filename hints) → Metacache searches TMDB via the cache → returns the best
candidate with external GUIDs (`imdb://…`, `tmdb://…`, `tvdb://…`) → Plex stores the GUID →
GETs **metadata** by rating key (seasons/episodes via `/children`) → Metacache synthesizes
the Plex JSON from cached upstream data → artwork URLs in the response point back at
Metacache's own image endpoint → Plex pulls posters/backdrops from the LAN. Everything
after the first match is served entirely from the local cache.

## 4. The key discovery: Plex Custom Metadata Providers

Plex announced Custom Metadata Providers on 2025-12-09 (PMS 1.43+, beta at the time;
legacy agent system is slated for full removal in 2026). The essentials:

- A **metadata provider** is any HTTP API returning metadata in Plex's standardized
  JSON format. It must expose:
  - `GET /movie` and/or `GET /tv` → the **MediaProvider definition** (identifier,
    title, version, supported Types, and Feature endpoints).
  - A **metadata** feature: `GET <key>/<ratingKey>` (plus `/children`,
    `/grandchildren`, `/images`).
  - A **match** feature: `POST <key>` for search/matching.
  - Optional **collection** feature (movie libraries).
- Providers are **unauthenticated** today; only Movie and TV libraries are supported
  (music later). Language/country arrive via `X-Plex-Language` / `X-Plex-Country`
  headers or query params.
- Users install a provider by pasting its URL into Settings → Metadata Agents →
  Add Provider, then compose one or more providers into an **agent**.

Implications for this project:

1. **No TLS/CA/DNS hacks for Plex.** The provider just needs to be reachable over HTTP
   on the LAN. (Bind to the LAN interface, not 0.0.0.0, since there's no auth yet.)
2. **Future-proof:** the legacy agent system dies in 2026; writing a provider now is
   the only path that keeps working.
3. **The API is young.** Plex explicitly warns of bugs and missing features. Keep the
   provider-schema mapping in one isolated module so churn is cheap (§11, mapper).

---

## 5. Provider identity & IDs

- **Identifier:** must start with `tv.plex.agents.custom.`; suffix only
  `[a-zA-Z0-9.]`; keep it unique. Use e.g.
  `tv.plex.agents.custom.metacache.movie` and `tv.plex.agents.custom.metacache.tv`.
- **GUIDs:** every item carries `{identifier}://{type}/{ratingKey}`, e.g.
  `tv.plex.agents.custom.metacache.tv://show/tmdb-show-15260`.
- **Rating keys:** `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` only, no slashes (they become part of the GUID).
  Proposed scheme (embed the source ID + indices, parseable with one regex):

  | Type | Rating key | Example |
  |---|---|---|
  | Movie | `tmdb-movie-{tmdbId}` | `tmdb-movie-19934` |
  | Show | `tmdb-show-{tmdbId}` | `tmdb-show-15260` |
  | Season | `tmdb-season-{tmdbId}-{n}` | `tmdb-season-4020-1` |
  | Episode | `tmdb-episode-{tmdbId}-{s}-{e}` | `tmdb-episode-4020-1-1` |
  | Collection | `tmdb-collection-{id}` | `tmdb-collection-9488` |

  (TVDB-only shows should still be resolvable: keep a `tvdbId` column and synthesize
  `tvdb-show-{id}` keys for those, or normalize through TMDB where possible.)

**Hybrid sources (TMDB + TVDB, confirmed):** TMDB is the primary source — best API,
free, no rate-limit pain. TVDB augments it: external-ID bridging, content ratings,
alternate episode orders, and coverage of shows TMDB is missing. Every item row in the
cache stores both `tmdbId` and `tvdbId` so either provider can be the lookup origin
(§7.4 schema already carries `source`/`source_id`).

---

## 6. Provider API contract (what to implement)

### 6.1 Provider definitions

`GET /movie` and `GET /tv` return:

```json
{
  "MediaProvider": {
    "identifier": "tv.plex.agents.custom.metacache.movie",
    "title": "Metacache Movie Provider",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "Types": [
      { "type": 1, "Scheme": [ { "scheme": "tv.plex.agents.custom.metacache.movie" } ] }
    ],
    "Feature": [
      { "type": "metadata", "key": "/library/metadata" },
      { "type": "match",    "key": "/library/metadata/matches" },
      { "type": "collection","key": "/library/collections" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Types: `1=movie, 2=show, 3=season, 4=episode, 18=collection`. Plex recommends **one
provider per parent type** (separate movie and TV providers) so agents can combine them
freely — follow that recommendation.

### 6.2 Metadata feature

- `GET /library/metadata/{ratingKey}` → `MediaContainer` with one `Metadata` object.
  - `includeChildren=1` (required support for shows/seasons) → include `Children`.
  - `episodeOrder` → honor alternate season orderings (TMDB episode groups).
- `GET /library/metadata/{ratingKey}/children` and `/grandchildren` → paged lists.
  **Paging is mandatory here** via `X-Plex-Container-Size` / `X-Plex-Container-Start`
  (default page size 20, start index 1); `totalSize` = all, `size` = this page.
- `GET /library/metadata/{ratingKey}/images` → recommended; returns all available
  image assets (coverPoster, background, backgroundSquare, clearLogo, snapshot).
- Return codes: `200` / `404` (unknown rating key) / `400` / `500`.
- Response-customization params (`includeFields`, `excludeElements`, …) are optional
  to support; the match endpoint benefits most (smaller responses). Support them —
  Plex sends them and they cut bandwidth.

### 6.3 Match feature

`POST /library/metadata/matches` — body fields (type is required; everything else
depends on type):

| Field | For types | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | all | 1/2/3/4 |
| `title` | movie, show | |
| `parentTitle` | season | |
| `grandparentTitle` | episode | |
| `year` | movie, show | optional |
| `guid` | all | external id, e.g. `tvdb://152831` — use it for exact pinning |
| `index` | season/episode | |
| `parentIndex` | episode | |
| `date` | episode | air date, used when indices absent |
| `filename` | all | relative file path — use for filename heuristics |
| `manual` | all | `1` → return ranked list for "Fix Match"; `0`/absent → best single result |
| `includeAdult` | all | filter adult content unless `1` |

Response is a `MediaContainer.Metadata[]` — best match first. Include `Guid[]`
(imdb/tmdb/tvdb ids) on results so Plex can pin subsequent refreshes without re-searching.

**Matching strategy (movies/shows):** TMDB search by title+year (cached); score by year
distance, title similarity (normalize punctuation/articles), filename hints; prefer
exact external-ID hits when `guid` is supplied; return the top candidate. For episodes,
match by `parentIndex`/`index` (or air `date`) against the already-pinned show — this is
why the show's season/episode structure must be cached eagerly (§8).

### 6.4 Metadata object shape (what to synthesize)

Per `Metadata.md` in the example repo: `ratingKey`, `key`, `guid`, `type`, `title`,
`originallyAvailableAt`, `thumb`, `art`, plus `Image[]` (recommend coverPoster +
background + clearLogo + backgroundSquare), `Genre[]`, `Guid[]`, `Rating[]`
(imdb/tmdb/rotten-tomatoes image ids), `Role[]/Director[]/Producer[]/Writer[]`,
`Country[]`, `Studio[]`, `Network[]` (TV), `Collection[]` (movies, if the collection
feature is advertised), `SeasonType[]` (alternate orders), and parent/grandparent
attributes for seasons/episodes. **All `url` fields must point back at Metacache's own
image endpoint** (see §7.3) so Plex never fetches art from the internet.

---

## 7. Caching design

### 7.1 Layers

1. **Synthesized provider responses** (the Plex JSON we return) — cheap to rebuild;
   cache briefly (or not at all) — they're derived from layer 2.
2. **Normalized upstream metadata** — the item store: movies/shows/seasons/episodes/
   people/collections as structured rows keyed by provider ID, with language variants.
   This is the real cache. TTL + ETag revalidation.
3. **Raw upstream HTTP** (for the ARR proxy face) — pass-through cache of provider API
   JSON keyed by URL.
4. **Images** — content-addressed files on disk.

### 7.2 Cache keys & TTLs

- Cache key = SHA-256 of the normalized URL (scheme + host + path + sorted query),
  optionally including the language/country tag so `de-DE` and `en-US` don't collide.
  Strip API keys from the key (and from logs).
- **TTL table** (start values; make per-provider configurable):

| Source | Content | TTL | Revalidation |
|---|---|---|---|
| TMDB API | item JSON | 24 h | ETag / Last-Modified → 304 |
| TMDB images | jpg/png | 30 d | none (URLs are content-addressed upstream) |
| TVDB API | item JSON | 24–48 h | ETag |
| Fanart.tv | art | 7 d | none |
| Search/match responses | list JSON | 12 h | none |
| Synthesized Plex JSON | derived | 1 h | n/a (rebuilt from item store) |

- **Stale-if-error:** serve stale entries when upstream 5xx / timeout / offline — this
  is what makes "internet down but library works" true.
- **429 handling:** a rate-limited request is retried up to `CachePolicy.MaxRetries`
  (default 2) instead of failing or serving stale — the wait honors `Retry-After` when
  present, otherwise exponential backoff (base × 2^attempt), both capped by
  `MaxRetryDelay` (default 30 s) so a distant Retry-After can't stall a refresh.
  Single-flight per key means concurrent callers share one retry sequence, never
  thundering-herding the provider. Every 429 response feeds the
  `metacache_upstream_rate_limited_total` counter (each retried response counted once).

### 7.3 Image endpoint

Upstream image URLs (e.g. `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/qk3eQ8…jpg`) are rewritten
to `http://{host}:{port}/img/{sha256-of-original-url}`. On miss, Metacache fetches the
image from upstream and stores it (per-file cap, default 20 MB); on hit, it's a local
file read (range-request aware). Plex's UI then loads every poster/backdrop from the LAN.
Filenames keep no upstream host/API info → cache stays private.

**Shipped (implementation notes):** `ImageStore` keeps extensionless content-addressed
files at `{dir}/{first2}/{sha256}`, written atomically; content type is derived from the
original URL, which is recorded in the `urls` table. `ImageCache` single-flights fetches
and enforces a total-bytes cap (default 10 GB) by evicting oldest-first. Images are
treated as immutable (no TTL) — bounded by the caps instead. `/img/{hash}` refetches
when the URL is known but the file is missing, and 404s for unknown/invalid hashes.

### 7.4 Storage

- **SQLite** (`metacache.db`): item store, cache index, stats. One file, zero ops,
  plenty for hundreds of thousands of items. WAL mode.
  - Sketch (implemented as `Metacache.Core/Cache/CacheStore.cs`; schema versioned via
    `PRAGMA user_version`, timestamps persisted as ISO-8601 UTC):
    ```sql
    items(id TEXT, kind TEXT, source TEXT, source_id TEXT, lang TEXT,
          json TEXT, fetched_at TEXT, expires_at TEXT, etag TEXT,
          PRIMARY KEY (id, lang))        -- one row per language variant
    upstream_cache(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- sha256 of URL
          url TEXT, status INT, content_type TEXT, body BLOB,
          fetched_at TEXT, expires_at TEXT, etag TEXT, last_modified TEXT, hits INT)
    urls(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- sha256 of original URL
          url TEXT, path TEXT,           -- path to image file
          size INT, fetched_at TEXT)
    ```
  - Indexes on `(source, source_id)`, `(kind, lang)`, `upstream_cache(expires_at)`.
- **Image store:** `images/ab/cdef1234…` content-addressed files.
- Sizing: a 2,000-movie library ≈ 4–8 GB of images + < 200 MB of JSON. Fine on any NAS.

## 8. Cache warming (the "companion" part)

**Shipped as M3 (§18).** The cache is most valuable when it's *already full* before
Plex asks. Warm it from the ARR apps themselves:

- **Radarr:** `GET /api/v3/movie` (API key via header) → tmdbIds of everything in your
  movie library → prefetch movie metadata + images + collections.
- **Sonarr:** `GET /api/v3/series` → tvdbIds → prefetch show, all seasons, all episodes,
  episode stills, alternate episode orders.
- **Lidarr** (once Plex supports music providers) and **Prowlarr** are future warmers.
- Also warm searchable headspace: TMDB trending/popular pages so "Fix Match" on a new
  file often hits cache.
- Schedule: nightly incremental + event-driven (watch the ARR apps' webhooks/API for
  new imports). A single full warm of a big library is a few thousand upstream requests;
  at TMDB's 50 rps that's minutes — and it only happens once.

This turns the ARR apps' existing databases into the *inventory* and Metacache into the
*pantry*: everything Plex will ever ask for is already local.

---

## 9. Language choice: C# / .NET (and why not C or C++)

**Recommendation: C# on .NET (8+, current LTS).** Reasons:

1. **First-class HTTP server** — Kestrel (ASP.NET Core) handles the provider API, the
   proxy, and the dashboard with zero native dependencies. Writing an HTTP proxy is
   ~100 lines, not a project.
2. **`HttpClient` + `SocketsHttpHandler`** gives pooled connections, retries, redirects,
   and TLS for upstream calls out of the box.
3. **SQLite** via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` (or EF Core if you want migrations) — no server,
   runs on any NAS.
4. **Cross-platform + tiny deploy** — single self-contained binary or Docker image on
   Linux/Windows/macOS/Synology; runs fine on the same box as Plex.
5. **Background services** (`IHostedService`) are the natural fit for the warmer and
   revalidation loops.
6. **Proof in the space:** `PlexModernMetadataProvider` is already a C#/.NET 10 Plex
   provider; Plex's own docs explicitly say "any language that can serve an HTTP API."
7. **Team velocity:** JSON serialization, testing (xUnit), and dependency management
   (NuGet) are boring and reliable — important when the provider schema is still moving.

**C++** is viable (cpp-httplib or Boost.Beast + libcurl + SQLite) but you'll spend most
of your effort on plumbing (HTTP parsing edge cases, TLS, JSON, pooling, packaging) that
.NET gives you free. Choose C++ only if you have a hard constraint (existing C++ codebase,
minimal-runtime deployment on weird hardware). **C** is not a sensible choice here:
HTTP/TLS/JSON in C is a maintenance burden with no payoff for a LAN metadata service.

If you're set on C++, use `cpp-httplib` for the server, `libcurl` for upstream, `nlohmann/json`,
`SQLite3` directly, and accept a slower build. The architecture in this doc is
language-agnostic either way.

---

## 10. The ARR proxy face (DNS override) — in scope

Sonarr/Radarr hardcode their metadata endpoints — no pluggable backend. To make them
consume the cache too:

- Run the same service on a second port (e.g. 443) as a **transparent caching reverse
  proxy** for `api.themoviedb.org`, `image.tmdb.org`, `api.thetvdb.com`,
  `webservice.fanart.tv`, and whatever else the ARR apps call.
- Override DNS for those hosts to the Metacache host:
  - Same machine: `/etc/hosts` (or `extra_hosts` in Docker Compose).
  - LAN-wide: Pi-hole / AdGuard Home custom DNS entries.
- **TLS is the catch:** the apps will use HTTPS with SNI for those real domains. The
  proxy must terminate TLS with certificates for those exact hostnames, signed by a
  **local CA** you generate (e.g. with `mkcert`) and install into the trust store of
  the hosts running the ARR apps / Plex. No pinning is known on these providers'
  endpoints, so this works — but it is the fiddliest part, and it's optional.

The provider face lands first (M1–M3); the proxy face lands in M4 for full offline
behavior. Until then the ARR apps keep using the internet for their own calls (imports,
UI art) while Plex still gets everything from the cache.

### §10.1 Implementation (shipped)

The proxy face runs as a second Kestrel endpoint on port 443 (configurable via
`Metacache:Proxy:HttpPort`). It is disabled by default (`Metacache:Proxy:Enabled=false`)
and opted into via config.

**Components:**

- **`ProxyRouter`** — maps incoming SNI hostnames to upstream base URLs. Default routes:
  `api.themoviedb.org` → `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`, `image.tmdb.org` →
  `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original`, `api.thetvdb.com` → `https://api4.thetvdb.com`,
  `webservice.fanart.tv` → `https://webservice.fanart.tv/v3`. Custom routes via
  `Metacache:Proxy:Routes:{hostname}`.
- **`CertManager`** — generates a self-signed local CA root (`data/certs/metacache-ca.pfx`)
  and per-hostname leaf certs signed by it, persisted to `data/certs/leaf-{hostname}.pfx`.
  The CA cert is downloadable at `GET /proxy/ca-cert` (PEM format) for trust store
  installation on ARR hosts.
- **`ProxyMiddleware`** — intercepts requests, reconstructs the original upstream URL from
  SNI hostname + path + query, strips `api_key` from the cache key (so secrets don't
  appear in the DB), fetches through the existing `UpstreamCache` (ETag revalidation,
  stale-if-error, 429 retry), and returns the response with `X-Cache-Source` header.
- **`GET /proxy/status`** — returns routed hostnames, CA subject, and thumbprint.

**Setup steps:**

1. Enable: `Metacache__Proxy__Enabled=true` (or `appsettings.json`).
2. Install the CA cert (`GET /proxy/ca-cert`) into the trust store of each ARR host.
3. Override DNS for `api.themoviedb.org`, `image.tmdb.org`, `api.thetvdb.com`,
   `webservice.fanart.tv` → Metacache host IP (Pi-hole, AdGuard, or `/etc/hosts`).
4. Radarr/Sonarr now hit Metacache instead of upstream — zero config change on the
   ARR apps themselves.

**What the ARR apps see:** identical responses to the real APIs, with identical cache keys.
The first request fetches upstream and caches; subsequent requests serve from cache with
automatic revalidation. Rate-limit headers pass through unchanged.

### §10.2 Bearer-token authentication (shipped)

Protected endpoints (`/admin/*`, `/webhook/*`, `POST /warm/*`) require a Bearer token
when `Metacache:Auth:ApiKey` is set. The token is sent as:

```
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

Or via the `X-API-Key` header (some webhook callers don't use `Authorization`):

```
X-API-Key: <key>
```

**Key comparison is constant-time** (`CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals`) to
prevent timing attacks.

When no key is configured (the default), authentication is entirely disabled — all
endpoints remain accessible without a token. This is backward compatible with existing
unauthenticated deployments.

**Unprotected routes** (always public, no token required):
- `GET /healthz` — liveness probe
- `GET /movie`, `GET /tv` — provider definitions (Plex needs these)
- `GET /library/*` — provider API (Plex needs these)
- `GET /img/*` — image serving (Plex needs these)
- `GET /cache/stats` — read-only stats
- `GET /metrics`, `GET /metrics/prometheus`, `GET /dashboard` — monitoring
- `GET /items`, `GET /guid/lookup` — query endpoints
- `GET /proxy/*` — proxy status and CA cert
- `GET /warm/status` — read-only warmer state

**Hard rule:** only `Metacache.Plex/Mappers` serializes to Plex's provider schema. When
Plex changes the API (it will — it's brand new), you change one folder.

## 12. Milestones

- **M0 — Skeleton:** .NET host, `/movie` + `/tv` provider definitions, health endpoint,
  Docker + Compose, config. *Definition of done:* Plex "Add Provider" accepts the URL
  and shows the provider; requests log. **Shipped.** Cache core (SQLite store,
  single-flight, ETag revalidation, stale-if-error) also shipped as M1 groundwork.
- **M1 — Movies:** match + metadata for movie libraries; GUIDs; image rewriting through
  the local endpoint; SQLite cache with TTL + ETag revalidation; 404/400 semantics.
  *DoD:* create a movie library using the provider; "Fix Match" finds films; refresh
  shows two upstream calls total. **Shipped** — see §16.
- **M2 — TV:** shows/seasons/episodes; `/children` + `/grandchildren` with paging;
  episode matching by index and air date; localization (X-Plex-Language); content
  ratings by country; alternate episode orders. *DoD:* a TV library works end to end
  with correct episode matching on re-scans. **Shipped** — see §17 (alternate
  episode orders still deferred).
- **M3 — Companion features:** Sonarr/Radarr warm-up jobs; metrics + dashboard
  (hit rate, per-provider counts, disk usage); manual purge + TTL tuning; stale-if-error
  offline mode. *DoD:* unplug the WAN and a full library refresh still completes.
  **Shipped** — see §18 (dashboard UI and the remaining tuning knobs still to come).
  Scheduled nightly + webhook-driven warming are included.
- **M4 — ARR proxy face:** transparent caching reverse proxy for
  `api.themoviedb.org`/`image.tmdb.org`/`api.thetvdb.com`/`webservice.fanart.tv` with
  DNS override (§10); local CA + per-hostname certs; multi-language warm; music
  provider when Plex ships it.

## 13. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Provider API is new; schema churn | Isolate all Plex serialization in `Mappers`; golden-file tests; pin against the example repo's `Metadata.md` |
| Legacy agents removed in 2026 | Custom providers are the replacement path — being early is an advantage |
| No auth on providers yet | Bind to LAN; firewall port; add API-key auth in front once Plex ships it |
| Matching quality (Plex "Fix Match") | Return rich `Guid[]`; support manual search ranked lists; filename heuristics; watch Plex forums for matching feedback |
| Provider ToS (TMDB/TVDB caching rules) | Personal, non-redistributed caching for a private library is the intended scope; don't ship caches to others; check current ToS before any public distribution |
| Rate limits during initial warm | Single-flight + per-host rate limiter + Retry-After handling; warm off-peak |
| TVDB went paid / rate-limited | Prefer TMDB as primary source; keep TVDB only as an ID bridge where needed |
| Storage growth | Image size cap, LRU eviction policy, dashboard + purge API |

---

## 14. Decisions & open items

**Locked (2026-08-24):**

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | C# / .NET 10 (§9) |
| Metadata sources | TMDB + TVDB hybrid, TMDB primary (§5) |
| ARR proxy face | In scope (§10, milestone M4) |

**Defaults chosen (override anytime):**

- **Hosting:** Docker image or self-contained binary, run on the same host as Plex.
- **Provider identifiers:** `tv.plex.agents.custom.metacache.movie` / `.tv` (suffix
  configurable).
- **HTTP port:** 8765 (configurable via env/config).

**Still open (no impact on M0–M2):** exact LAN IP/hostname the provider URL will use
(affects image URL rewriting in §7.3), TVDB API key provisioning, and whether the ARR
proxy face terminates TLS for ARR apps on this box or via Pi-hole LAN-wide.

---

## 15. Match scoring (M1)

**Goal:** turn a Plex match request (§6.3) into a ranked list of TMDB candidates — one
best match for auto-matching, or a full ranked list for manual "Fix Match". Implemented
as a pure, unit-tested engine in `Metacache.Core/Matching/`; the M1 provider routes
requests through it.

### 15.1 Inputs

| Hint | Source | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | match body | title similarity |
| `year` | match body | year score |
| `filename` | match body | filename year + token overlap |
| `guid` (e.g. `imdb://tt0088763`) | match body | exact external-ID match (overrides all) |
| `manual` | match body | ranked list vs. single best |
| `includeAdult` | match body | adult filtering |
| `X-Plex-Language` | header/query | small tiebreak bonus |

### 15.2 Normalization (`TitleNormalizer`)

Before any comparison: lowercase → replace smart quotes with ASCII → map non-
alphanumerics to spaces → collapse whitespace → strip leading articles (`the`/`a`/`an`) →
map trailing standalone roman numerals to digits (`rocky ii` → `rocky 2`, `episode iv` →
`episode 4`). Similarity between two normalized titles = `max(token-Jaccard, bigram-Dice)`
so word reordering and small spelling variants both score well.

### 15.3 Candidate score (weighted sum, clamped to [0, 1] → ×100)

| Component | Weight | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Title similarity | 0.45 | max over candidate `title` and `original_title` |
| Year | 0.25 | exact = 1.0, ±1 = 0.4, else 0 (missing input = 0.5 neutral) |
| Filename | 0.20 | 0.6·(file-year match) + 0.4·(filename-token Jaccard); no filename = 0.5 neutral |
| Popularity | 0.10 | `1 − e^(−popularity/200)` — tiebreaker only |
| Language | +0.02 | request language primary tag == candidate `original_language` |

**Exact external GUID** (`guid` matches a candidate's `imdb://`/`tmdb://`/`tvdb://` id)
overrides the weighted sum → score 1.0. Adult candidates are filtered out unless
`includeAdult=1`. Ties break by popularity, then stable input order.

### 15.4 Thresholds & response shaping (`MatchPolicy`)

- Auto-match: return the best candidate only if `score ≥ 0.60`; below that, return an
  empty container so Plex shows "Fix Match" instead of committing a wrong match.
- Manual: return all candidates with `score ≥ 0.15`, sorted descending, capped at 20.

### 15.5 M1 flow

1. Map the Plex match body → `MatchHint`.
2. `guid` present → TMDB `find` by external id (exact). Otherwise TMDB `search` by
   title+year (both through `UpstreamCache`, single-flighted).
3. **Enrich** the top ~8 search candidates with details (imdb id, posters, runtime,
   original language) via `MetadataCache` — needed for exact-GUID scoring, artwork, and
   the response `Guid[]`.
4. `MatchScorer.Score(hint, candidates)` → ranked `ScoredMatch[]` (with per-component
   breakdown for diagnostics).
5. Map to `MediaContainer.Metadata[]` (M1 mapper) — best first, include `Guid[]`.

### 15.6 Edge cases & limitations

- Remakes/reboots with identical titles are separated by year; genuinely identical
  title+year pairs fall back to popularity and remain a known coin-flip (manual fix
  available).
- Filename group names (e.g. `-RARBG`) aren't reliably distinguishable from title words;
  only well-known release tags (codec/resolution/source) are stripped.
- Weights and thresholds live in `MatchPolicy`, which is now bound from the
  `Metacache:Matching` configuration section (env overrides like
  `Metacache__Matching__AutoMatchThreshold` work) — tunable at runtime without recompiling.

### 15.7 TV matching (seasons/episodes)

Seasons and episodes use their own weight set — the show title confirms identity while
**structure (index/air-date) acts as a gate**: a definite index mismatch drops the
structure component to 0, keeping wrong seasons/episodes below the auto threshold.

| Component | Weight | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Show title | 0.40 | hint `parentTitle` (season) or `grandparentTitle` (episode) vs candidate parent (show) title |
| Structure | 0.35 | season: season-index equality; episode: ½·(season) + ½·(episode) index equality, or exact air-date equality when no index hints exist |
| Filename | 0.15 | filename tokens vs show title; `S01E05` / `Season N` parsed from the path supply structure when the body has no index |
| Popularity | 0.10 | tiebreaker |

Structural hints are taken from the request body first, then the filename; with no
structural hint at all the component is neutral (0.5). Exact-GUID override, adult
filtering, thresholds and manual/auto shaping are shared with movie matching.

**Shipped:** the engine (`MatchHint` with `MatchKind`, `MatchCandidate` with TV fields,
`MatchScorer` dispatch, `TitleNormalizer`, `FilenameParser` with SxxEyy/`Season N`,
`MatchPolicy` TV weights) with unit tests — see `tests/…/Matching/`.

### 15.8 TVDB fallback & augmentation

TVDB (v4) is a second TV source behind TMDB, wired in at two points where TMDB is
chronically thin — old/soap/obscure shows often have the series row but no episode
data:

- **Episode metadata fallback.** When `GET /tv/{id}/season/{s}/episode/{e}` 404s, the
  show's `tvdb_id` (from `/tv/{id}/external_ids`) resolves the TVDB series and the
  episode at that structure position is served instead. The item keeps its
  `tmdb-*` rating key (Plex already routes on it) but carries a truthful `tvdb://{id}`
  GuidItem and a locally-rewritten `/img/` thumb from TVDB's artwork URL.
- **Match augmentation.** When TMDB returns **zero** episodes for a show (or for the
  hinted season), episode matching falls back to the full TVDB episode list so
  index/air-date matching still works; candidates map through `TvdbMapper` into the
  same `TmdbEpisode` shape the scorer consumes (`FromTvdb` keeps GUIDs honest).

**Client (`TvdbClient`).** TVDB v4 requires a bearer token from `POST /v4/login` — the
key alone is not accepted on data endpoints. The login is kept **in memory only**
(~25 days) and deliberately never routed through `UpstreamCache`, so a credential
never persists in the cache DB (same rule as the TMDB key, §16). A 401 from a data
call (expired/revoked token) drops the token, re-logs in, and retries once. Data calls
use `GET /v4/series/{id}/episodes/default` — the full series plus every episode in one
shot (no paging) — routed through the gateway with a 24 h TTL, single-flight, ETag
revalidation and stale-if-error, the bearer token riding only in the Authorization
header, so TVDB latency lands in the per-provider duration histogram
(`provider="api4.thetvdb.com"`). A blank `Metacache:Tvdb:ApiKey` throws
`TvdbConfigurationException` on use; fallbacks then simply never fire.

### 15.9 (reserved)

### 15.10 Manual match overrides & unmatched capture

Plex re-matches the same items on every library refresh, so a title that scores below
the auto threshold (or that TMDB simply can't find) fails forever and needs a manual
Fix Match every time. This section makes those corrections **persistent**: a pinned
override is consulted before any upstream search, so the fix sticks across refreshes.

**Override keys.** Every match hint derives a deterministic lookup key
(`MatchOverrideKeys.ForHint`): the request guid when Plex sent one (Plex re-sends the
guid it stored after a manual fix, so a guid-keyed pin fires on every refresh),
otherwise a normalized `kind:title:year` (season uses the parent show title, episode
the grandparent show title; titles are lowercased and whitespace-collapsed).

**Consult-before-search.** `POST /library/metadata/matches` looks up the override for
the hint's key first. A hit resolves the pinned target (`tmdb-movie-…`, `tmdb-show-…`,
`tmdb-season-…`, `tmdb-episode-…` — all parsed via `RatingKey`) through the cached
provider services and returns it directly: **auto** mode answers with just the pin; a
**manual** Fix Match returns the pin first, followed by the ranked candidates
(deduped). If the pinned target 404s upstream (deleted title), the pin falls back to
normal matching rather than failing the refresh. Pinned hints are admin-owned, so a
broken pin is never recorded as unmatched.

**Unmatched capture.** An **auto** match that returns zero candidates is a genuine
failure — the hint (title, year, guid, filename, parent/grandparent titles, indexes,
air date) is recorded in the `unmatched` table, keyed the same way the consult path
reads, with a counter bumped on recurrence and a `last_seen_at` for triage.

**Admin surface** (`MatchOverrideEndpoints`):

- `GET /admin/overrides` — list pins; `POST /admin/overrides` — create/replace a pin
  (`key`, `kind`, `target` tmdb rating key, optional `notes`; validates kind/target
  consistency); `DELETE /admin/overrides/{key}` — remove a pin.
- `GET /admin/unmatched` — review failures (count + last seen);
  `POST /admin/unmatched/{key}/pin` — create the override from an entry and drop it
  (the one-click fix loop); `DELETE /admin/unmatched/{key}` — dismiss a single entry;
  `DELETE /admin/unmatched` — clear all.

Storage is two `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` tables in the existing SQLite store
(`match_overrides`, `unmatched`), added as schema **v2** so v1 databases upgrade in
place (`PRAGMA user_version`).

## 16. M1 — movies shipped (implementation notes)

M1 lands the full movie loop: Plex match → ranked result → metadata → local artwork,
with every TMDB call behind the cache. Notes on the choices made:

**TMDB auth is header-based — with a legacy fallback.** The API Read Access Token is
sent as `Authorization: Bearer`, so URLs, cache keys and logs never contain the
secret. A live probe found that legacy v3 API keys (32-char hex) are **rejected as
Bearer (401)** and only work as the `api_key` query parameter — so `TmdbOptions.Auth`
supports `Auto` (default: probes `/authentication` once per process and picks the
mode the key accepts), `Bearer`, and `Query`. In `Query` mode the cache key is still
computed from the secret-free URL via `UpstreamCache`'s new `cacheKey` override, so
the key never lands in the cache DB. The header support itself required a small,
general extension to the cache gateway: `UpstreamRequest` carries optional per-
request headers, forwarded by `HttpUpstreamClient` — the ARR proxy face (M4) will
reuse this for Sonarr/Radarr header keys.

**M1 uses the raw-HTTP cache layer** (`UpstreamCache`) for all TMDB JSON — search/find
12 h TTL, movie details 24 h — which already delivers single-flight, ETag
revalidation, stale-if-error and per-language keys (the URL carries `language`). The
normalized `items` store (`MetadataCache`) is exercised starting in M2, where TV
season/episode structures need indexable rows; movies are fully served by the raw
layer. A match is search + one details call (the enriched winner); a guid-pinned match
is find + one details call; a manual search enriches the top 8 candidates in parallel.

**Artwork is fully local.** `MovieMapper` rewrites every TMDB poster/backdrop URL to
`/img/{sha256}` via `ImageCache.RewriteToLocalPath`; Plex pulls art from Metacache and
`/img` fetches+stores on first request (self-healing). Match items carry a rewritten
`thumb` too, so even the Fix Match dialog never touches the internet. Live testing
caught one hole: nothing registered those hashes before the first fetch, so the very
first Plex image request 404'd — the provider service now calls
`ImageCache.RegisterUrl` for each artwork URL it emits (a lazy, idempotent `urls`
row), making every rewritten `/img/{hash}` resolvable from the moment it's served.

**Schema quirk handled:** Plex's metadata object legitimately has both `guid` (string)
and `Guid` (array) — plus `studio`/`Studio`. System.Text.Json's default
case-insensitive conflict check rejects those pairs, so provider responses serialize
with `PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = false` (`ProviderJson`); every property name is
pinned by an explicit attribute, so nothing else changes.

**Deferred to M2 (kept the wire models ready):** collections, `Network[]`,
`SeasonType[]`, alternate episode orders, and response-customization params
(`includeFields`/`excludeElements`). M1 serves `Guid[]`, `Genre[]`, `Image[]`,
`Rating[]` (TMDB vote), `Country[]`, `Studio[]`, tagline, summary, duration and year
— the fields Plex needs for a complete movie library.

---

## 17. M2 — TV shipped (implementation notes)

M2 wires TMDB TV data into the §15.7 structure-gated scoring engine and ships the
paged hierarchy endpoints, plus cast/crew and content ratings for both movies and TV.

**Shows, seasons, episodes.** `TvProviderService` mirrors the movie service: a show
match is search (or external-GUID find) → score → enrich the winner; season and
episode matches resolve the show first, then gate on structure — `index`/`parentIndex`
(and `SxxEyy` filename parsing) via the scorer, or exact `date` equality when only an
air date is given — so a wrong season or episode can never be committed. A season
match enriches the winning season's episodes (or all seasons when only an air date is
supplied); manual match lists are ranked exactly like movies. Rating keys are
`tmdb-show-{id}`, `tmdb-season-{id}-{n}`, `tmdb-episode-{id}-{s}-{e}`.

**Hierarchy endpoints.** `GET /library/metadata/{ratingKey}/children` returns seasons
of a show or episodes of a season; `/grandchildren` returns every episode of a show.
Both page via Plex's `X-Plex-Container-Size`/`X-Plex-Container-Start` headers
(`PlexPaging`), defaulting to a full page with `size`/`totalSize` in the
`MediaContainer`.

**Cast/crew and content ratings.** `PeopleMapper` emits `Role[]` (cast) and
`Director[]`/`Producer[]`/`Writer[]` (crew) from TMDB credits, with profile photos
rewritten to `/img/{hash}` like all artwork; movies enrich from `/movie/{id}/credits`,
shows from `/tv/{id}/credits`. Content ratings come from `/movie/{id}/release_dates`
(certifications) and `/tv/{id}/content_ratings`, resolved by `X-Plex-Country` (falls
back to the US rating). The extra calls run in parallel and are cached.

**GUID pinning needed real external ids.** A `tmdb://` pin was always exact, but an
`imdb://`/`tvdb://` pin on a show built its candidate from a TMDB *summary*, which
carries only `tmdb://` — so the scorer's exact-GUID override never fired and the auto
threshold filtered the result to empty. The movie flow avoided this because
`/movie/{id}` includes `imdb_id`; TV needs the separate `/tv/{id}/external_ids` call.
The show match flow now enriches guid-pinned candidates with their real external ids
(`find` + `show` + `external_ids` = 3 calls, mirroring the movie DoD) so the override
fires and the pinned show is returned exactly.

**Contract gaps caught by tests.** (1) Plex's `guid`/`Guid` case collision is shared
by every kind, so all provider JSON keeps the case-sensitive `ProviderJson` options.
(2) The TV images endpoints initially served raw TMDB URLs instead of rewritten
`/img/{hash}` assets — the rewrite helper is now applied to every served image.
(3) A fixture that served one movie's details for every `/movie/{id}` hid enrichment
bugs; distinct fixtures now exist per item.

**Deferred:** collections, alternate episode orders, `Network[]`, `SeasonType[]`, and
`includeFields`/`excludeElements` response customization. Wire models for all of
these already exist in `MetadataModels.cs`.

**Live check against real TMDB (Read Access Token) found one gap:** shows and seasons
emitted no `Rating[]` even though episodes did (and movies always had). The mapper
now emits the TMDB audience rating on show/season items too (seasons inherit the
show's vote). Everything else verified live: structure-gated episode matching by
index and by air date, `/children` + `/grandchildren` paging (default 20, header
overrides), complete `Guid[]` (tmdb+imdb+tvdb) and cast/crew with rewritten `/img`
thumbs, country-aware content rating, real poster fetch through `/img`, and repeat
matches adding zero upstream calls.

---

## 18. M3 — cache warming + metrics shipped (implementation notes)

M3 turns the ARR apps' libraries into the cache inventory and adds the metrics
surface. Notes on the choices made:

**The warmer reuses the provider services.** `CacheWarmer` (Metacache.Plex/Warming)
calls `MovieProviderService.GetMovieMetadataAsync` / `TvProviderService.GetShowMetadataAsync`
for each library item, so every fetch flows through the normal cached gateway (TTL,
single-flight, ETag) and artwork registration — the warm is literally a headless
Plex refresh. A Radarr movie costs the details+credits+release-dates calls; a Sonarr
series resolves its tvdbId via the find endpoint, then fetches the show, every
season, and every episode, pulling show/season posters and episode stills through the
image cache. All of it is cached, so the next real refresh is a cache hit.

**ARR API keys ride in headers.** `ArrClient` queries `/api/v3/movie` and
`/api/v3/series` with `X-Api-Key`, so keys never appear in URLs, logs, or cache keys
(the key is the URL sha256). The calls DO flow through the upstream gateway, so ARR
latency lands in the per-provider duration histogram (provider = the ARR host, e.g.
`radarr`/`sonarr`), 429s count in the rate-limited counter and retry with backoff,
and concurrent callers single-flight. The policy is a **zero TTL with stale-if-error
OFF**: every call still reaches the ARR app (the inventory stays on-demand fresh —
the stored entry is only an ETag validator), and a down ARR app fails fast as a warm
error instead of silently warming from stale inventory.

**The warmer writes `items` rows.** Every warmed movie/show/season/episode gets a row
in the normalized store (kind/source/source-id), which finally exercises the `items`
table (§7.4) and feeds the per-kind counts. `POST /warm/movies|shows|all` runs with
bounded concurrency (`Metacache:Arr:Concurrency`, default 4), returns a run summary,
and 409s while another run is in flight; `GET /warm/status` exposes the live state.

**Hit rate is a process counter, not a query.** `UpstreamCache` now increments
Interlocked request/hit counters (served-from-cache counts as a hit, including
stale-if-error), so `GET /metrics` reports a live hit rate without scanning the DB.
The endpoint also reports upstream-cache entries/bytes, per-kind item counts, image
files/bytes on disk, and the SQLite file size (`null` for `:memory:`).

**Scheduling and webhooks.** The nightly warm is a `BackgroundService`
(`ScheduledWarmHostedService`) that waits for the next occurrence of
`Metacache:Warm:ScheduleTime` (default 03:00, `HH:mm`) via a `TimeProvider`-based
delay (unit-tested with a fake clock) and runs `/warm/all`. Event-driven warming:
`POST /webhook/radarr` and `/webhook/sonarr` parse the ARR webhook payload
(`eventType: Test` is acknowledged, otherwise the `movie.tmdbId` / `series.tvdbId`
is warmed via the single-item `WarmMovieAsync`/`WarmShowByTvdbAsync` paths, which
reuse the exact same per-item logic as the full-library runs; 409 while a warm is
in flight). Point Sonarr/Radarr's webhook connections at these URLs.

**Dashboard.** `GET /dashboard` serves a minimal, self-contained HTML page (embedded
in the endpoint — no external JS/CDN, so it works with the WAN down) that polls
`/metrics` every 3 s and renders the hit rate (color-coded), request counters,
per-kind item bars, disk usage, and a 120-point hit-rate sparkline. Verified live
in the Preview tab.

The sparkline overlays two series: the browser's own 3 s polling (blue) and the
last 120 `/metrics/prometheus` scrapes (amber), served from a server-side
`ScrapeHistory` ring buffer that records a snapshot (unix time + counters) on
every scrape and is exposed through `/metrics` as `scrapeHistory`. Keeping the
history server-side means it survives page reloads and tracks the real scrape
interval however Prometheus is configured; the overlay is simply empty until a
Prometheus job actually scrapes.

**Prometheus scrape endpoint.** `GET /metrics/prometheus` renders the same data in
Prometheus text exposition format (`text/plain; version=0.0.4`): counters carry
the `_total` suffix (`metacache_cache_requests_total`), the hit ratio and size
metrics are gauges, per-kind item counts use a `kind` label, and `metacache_db_bytes`
is omitted entirely for `:memory:` stores (empty series are dropped, so an empty
store emits no `metacache_items_by_kind` instances). Point a Prometheus/Grafana
scraper at it and alert on hit-rate or disk drift.

The scrape surface also exposes upstream request durations and rate limiting:
`metacache_upstream_request_duration_seconds` is a histogram (buckets 0.05 s to
10 s) labeled by provider — "tmdb" for api.themoviedb.org, "images" for
image.tmdb.org — recorded by `UpstreamCache`/`ImageCache` around real upstream
requests only (cache hits are excluded, and a failed request still lands in the
histogram). Providers are derived from the request host, so a future third
upstream shows up automatically. The TMDB rate-limit surface has two parts:
`metacache_tmdb_rate_limit_remaining`/`_limit` gauges from X-RateLimit-*
response headers, and `metacache_upstream_rate_limited_total`, a per-provider
counter incremented on every 429. The live API check found that TMDB's current
API no longer sends X-RateLimit-* headers on success responses (verified with
curl), so the gauges stay absent (unknown) against real TMDB — the 429 counter
is the reliable throttle signal, and the rules file's `MetacacheRateLimited`
alert keys off it.

The scrape surface also exposes warm-run state so alerts can fire on warming
failures: `metacache_warm_running`, per-source last-run gauges
(`metacache_warm_last_{items,images,missing,errors,success}` with a `source`
label), and `metacache_warm_last_timestamp_seconds` (completion time of the most
recent attempt, success or failure — `WarmStatus.CompletedAt`, set in
`RunAsync`). `monitoring/metacache-alerts.yml` ships six recommended rules
(`promtool check rules`-clean): host down, hit rate below 80% over 10 min (via
`rate()` on the `_total` counters, with a traffic floor so an idle cache stays
silent — the lifetime `metacache_cache_hit_ratio` gauge resets on restart and is
not alert-grade), image-cache disk > 10 GiB, upstream+DB disk > 5 GiB, warm runs
completing with `errors > 0`, and no warm attempt for 36 h. Thresholds are
comments-tunable per deployment.

**Live run against real Radarr/Sonarr found three gaps (all fixed):** (1) a show
whose content ratings had no US entry crashed `PeopleMapper.Select` —
`FirstOrDefault` on a value-tuple list returns the default tuple `(null, null)`
(never null), so `match is null` never fired and `.All` ran on the null `Values`
list; the selector now checks the tuple's `Iso` instead. (2) A warm that threw
left `/warm/status` stuck at `isRunning: true`; `RunAsync` now resets the status
on failure. (3) The show warm fetched seasons (with embedded episodes) but not the
dedicated per-episode endpoint Plex uses, so the first refresh paid one call per
episode; the warm now fetches every episode endpoint too. After the fixes, a full
refresh of the warmed subset (movies + show + seasons + all 40 episode requests)
added **zero** upstream calls.

**Deferred to M4+:** trending/popular search warm-up, episode-level webhook warming
(webhooks currently warm the whole imported show), and the remaining M3 tuning
knobs (manual TTL tuning). `items` rows are written by the warmer only —
provider-served lookups don't yet record rows, so per-kind counts reflect warm runs.

---

## 19. Queryable cache index — items search + GUID lookup (shipped)

The normalized `items` table exists since M1 but nothing could *query* it — this
section turns it into the stack's local metadata API (the "metadata database" pivot
from the M3 brainstorm): `GET /items` searches the index, `GET /guid/lookup`
translates any GUID across imdb/tmdb/tvdb. Every tool in the stack (Overseerr,
Tautulli, scripts, a future Plex search integration) can now ask Metacache instead
of TMDB.

**Schema v3: the index columns.** `items` gains `title TEXT` and `year INTEGER`,
plus `ix_items_title`. Fresh databases get them in `CREATE TABLE`; v1/v2 databases
are upgraded in place by `ALTER TABLE` steps in `EnsureSchema`, each guarded by a
`pragma_table_info` column check so re-runs are idempotent (`PRAGMA user_version`
moves 2 → 3). `CachedItem` carries the new fields, and `CacheStore.PutItem` upserts
them. The warmer (`RecordItem`) now records titles/years derived from the TMDB
objects it already fetches — a movie's `title` + `release_date` year, a show's
`name` + `first_air_date` year, seasons inheriting the show's, episodes using
their own `air_date` year — so a warmed library is searchable by title with no
extra upstream calls.

**`GET /items` — search the index.** Filters (all optional, combined):
`kind` (movie/show/season/episode), `q` (case-insensitive title substring —
`LIKE ... ESCAPE '\'` with `%`/`_`/`\` escaped so queries match literally),
`guid` (any GUID the lookup service accepts — resolved to its tmdb source id(s)
first, so `?guid=imdb://tt0088763` finds the cached item; an unresolvable guid is
404), and `fresh=true` (only rows with `expires_at > now`). `limit` defaults to 50
(max 500). Response is `{ total, items: [...] }` — `total` counts without the
limit, `items` are `{ id, kind, source, sourceId, lang, title, year, fetchedAt,
expiresAt }` sorted case-insensitively by title. Parameter validation: bad kind /
fresh / limit → 400. All filtering happens in SQL (`SearchItems`), so it scales
with the index rather than loading rows.

**`GET /guid/lookup` — translate across sources.** `GuidLookupService` parses
`imdb://tt…`, `tvdb://…`, `tmdb://…`, Plex rating keys (`tmdb-movie-105`,
`tmdb-show-15260`, season/episode keys resolving at the show level), and bare
forms (`tt…` = imdb, digits = tmdb). Resolution walks the cached TMDB client:
imdb → `/find` (movie results first, then tv), tvdb → `/find` by `tvdb_id`,
tmdb → the rating-key kind or, for a bare id, the local index's kind — falling
back to a show-then-movie probe (the probed 404 is cached). Movie equivalents
come from `/movie/{id}` (imdb), show equivalents from `/tv/{id}` + `/tv/{id}/external_ids`
(imdb + tvdb). The response echoes `{ guid, kind, title, year, imdb, tmdb, tvdb,
tmdbId, itemId, cached }` — `itemId`/`cached` report whether the title is in the
local index (a movie is `movie-{id}`, a show `show-{id}`, matching the warmer's id
scheme). First lookup of a guid pays 2–3 upstream calls; every repeat is served
entirely from cache (find + details are cached by the gateway). Unknown guid → 404.

**Design notes.** Both endpoints are read-only and mounted outside `/admin` — they
are the cache index API, not admin tools. The index is as fresh as the last warm
(the warmer is the only writer), so title search answers "what's in my warmed
library", while guid lookup is cache-backed but always resolvable (it fills from
upstream on demand). Movies have no tvdb equivalent in TMDB, so `tvdb` is null for
movie lookups by construction; the equivalence set is whatever TMDB actually
knows.

## 20. Predictive warming — the Plex play-event webhook (shipped)

The full-library warm covers everything the ARR apps know about, but the first play
of anything new still pays upstream. Predictive warming inverts that: on
**playback start**, Plex tells us exactly what the user is about to watch next, so
Metacache pre-fetches the played item, the next episodes, and similar titles — the
next autoplay is a pure cache hit.

**`POST /webhook/plex`** consumes the standard Plex webhook JSON (`PlexPlayParser`
— case-insensitive property lookup for cross-PMS-version tolerance). Only
`event: media.play` (playback start) triggers a warm; every other event (`pause`,
`stop`, `scrobble`, the settings test button) answers `{ "result": "ignored" }`
without touching the cache, and malformed bodies are 400. Non-movie/episode
metadata types (`track`, `clip`, `photo`) are ignored too. While any other warm is
in flight the webhook answers 409, same as the ARR webhooks.

**Resolution is best-effort** (`CacheWarmer.WarmPredictiveAsync`, published as a
`predictive` run in the warm status/metrics):

- **Movie** — the metadata `Guid[]` (plus the legacy `guid` field) is scanned for
  `tmdb://`/`imdb://`/`tvdb://` entries and resolved through `GuidLookupService`
  (cached find); with no usable guid, the title+year falls back to the normal
  movie auto-match. Unresolvable → the run reports `missing: 1` and does nothing.
- **Episode** — the show is resolved from a show-level guid if present, otherwise
  by auto-matching `grandparentTitle` (+year). (Episode-level guids can't route to
  a show, so title matching is the primary path.) Then `WarmShowAroundAsync`
  warms the show card (metadata + artwork), the played season, and the played
  episode plus the next three in the season — the autoplay queue. If the played
  episode is the season finale, the next season's metadata and first two episodes
  are primed too, so the queue crosses the season boundary without a miss.

**Related titles** come from TMDB's similarity relation — new `GetSimilarMoviesAsync`
/ `GetSimilarShowsAsync` client methods (`/movie/{id}/similar`, `/tv/{id}/similar`,
search policy TTL). The top `SimilarDepth` (3) are warmed per play: movies fully
(`WarmOneMovieAsync`, details + artwork), shows as cards only (metadata + artwork,
no season crawl) so a play event stays bounded — one movie play costs ~15
cached-upstream calls, all behind 12–24 h TTLs and single-flight.

**Setup:** in Plex, Settings → Webhooks → add a webhook pointing at
`http://<metacache-host>:8765/webhook/plex`. The warmer answers the connection
test with `ignored` (no test event ever warms anything).

## 21. Library browse + sized image variants (shipped)

The provider definitions previously advertised only `metadata` and `match`, and
`/img` served one (original) size. This section adds the browse surface — so a
library can be searched and listed **entirely from the local cache** — and
locally-resized image variants for lightweight list views.

**Browse endpoints** (`LibraryBrowseEndpoints`, advertised in `ProviderCatalog` as
the `search` and `recentlyAdded` features):

- `GET /library/search?title=&kind=movie|show&year=` — searches the warmed index
  (case-insensitive title substring via the §19 `SearchItems`, optional exact year)
  and returns a Plex-shaped `MediaContainer`.
- `GET /library/recentlyAdded` — the most recently warmed items (index ordered by
  `fetched_at`).

Both page with the standard `X-Plex-Container-Size`/`Start` headers (offset is
applied in SQL, like `/children`) and return **movies and shows only** — seasons
and episodes are `/items` territory, not library-browse rows. Mixed results carry
the generic container identifier; single-kind requests echo the movie/tv provider
identifier. Every row is built from the index (`BrowseMapper`) with an exact
tmdb rating key + guid, so a click routes straight to a cache-hit metadata fetch.

**Schema v4: `items.thumb`.** The warmer records the rewritten `/img/{hash}`
artwork path for every row (poster for movies/shows/seasons, still for episodes),
so browse rows carry artwork without touching upstream. `EnsureSchema` adds the
column in place for older databases, exactly like v3's title/year.

**Sized image variants** (`GET /img/{hash}?width=N`). The size set is a bounded,
TMDB-style list of longest-side steps — `ImageSizes.Allowed` = 92/154/185/342/500/
780/1280 — so the variant cache stays finite (one file per size per original; a
client can't fill the disk with arbitrary-size requests; anything else is 400).
On first request for a size, the stored original is resized locally with
SixLabors.ImageSharp (3.1.x — the last Apache-compatible line; 4.x requires a
commercial license key, so the pin is deliberate and Dependabot is configured to
keep it on 3.1.x) into a JPEG variant written atomically next to the original
(`{root}/{first2}/{hash}.{size}.jpg`), single-flighted per hash+size, and served
from disk after that. Originals smaller than the requested size are never
upscaled (the original is served), and undecodable originals (e.g. an SVG slipped
through) fall back to the original bytes — a variant request can never fail a
valid image. Evicting an original also removes its variants. Browse thumbs point
at `?width=185` (`BrowseMapper.ThumbWidth`), so list views pull small images
entirely from local disk.
