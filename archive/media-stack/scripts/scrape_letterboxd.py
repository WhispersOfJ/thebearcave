"""Scrapes list URLs off Letterboxd's featured-lists page into a flat text
file, one absolute URL per line, for stack-letterboxd-radarr-list-random to
pick from.

/lists/featured/ is not in robots.txt's Disallow set (checked live:
User-agent: * only blocks sort/filter path segments - /by/, /on/, /tag/,
/genre/, /country/, /language/, /decade/, /films/year/, /films/*/size/large/,
/friends/, /popular/this/*, none of which apply here). The page is fully
server-rendered with no Cloudflare JS challenge (confirmed live), unlike
some other Letterboxd paths this stack's own Letterboxd-to-Radarr feature
already had to work around (the control panel's LETTERBOXD_HEADERS
comment) - still using the same full browser-shaped header set anyway,
since a bare requests default UA is the one thing confirmed to trip a
challenge on other paths.
