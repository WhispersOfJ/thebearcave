"""Reconcile what Radarr/Sonarr think they have against what Plex actually serves.

Matching is by absolute file path. Both sides use the same /data/<library>/...
paths through the same mount, so path equality is exact where title matching
would produce false pairs across editions and releases.

WHY THIS READS THE API AND NOT THE DATABASE
-------------------------------------------
The first version of this script asked Plex's SQLite DB whether every
metadata_items row for a path was `deleted_at`-flagged, and called the path
invisible if so. That is wrong, and it produced a confident 75-item false
positive on 2026-08-13.

The reason is multi-version episodes. Frieren S02E01 has both a BluRay and a
WEB-DL file attached to the same episode. Plex keeps superseded metadata_items
rows that still reference a file path, while the live episode serves that same
file through a different row. Grouping by path and checking deleted_at cannot
tell those apart, so every second version looked orphaned. All 75 were playable
the whole time.

`/library/sections/<id>/all` (movies) and `/allLeaves` (episodes) return every
Part Plex will actually serve. That is the same thing a user sees, so it is the
only defensible definition of "in Plex". Nothing here reads deleted_at.

Buckets:
  MISSING_FROM_PLEX - Arr has the file, the file is on disk, Plex does not
                      serve it. Genuine gap. Fix: scan, or fix the naming Plex
                      cannot match (a file spanning several episodes will never
                      match, no matter how often you scan).
  FILE_GONE         - Arr believes it has a file, the file is not on disk.
                      An Arr-side problem, not a Plex one.
  UNSUPPORTED       - Plex has no demuxer for the container (.iso, .img, disc
                      images). Absent by design; scanning cannot help.
  ORPHAN_IN_PLEX    - Plex lists it, the file is on disk, no Arr app tracks
                      the path. Usually a manual import, or a series removed
                      from Sonarr whose files stayed.
  STALE_IN_PLEX     - Plex lists it and the file is gone. Not damage: this
                      stack disables autoEmptyTrash on purpose, so removed
                      items linger in the library until trash is emptied.
                      Bulk listings do not carry Plex's accessible/exists
                      attributes - they are always absent on /allLeaves - so
                      the only way to tell these from real orphans is to stat
                      the file. Skipping that check reported 1,238 phantom
                      orphans on 2026-08-13.

The on-disk check runs inside the plex container, because the question is
whether Plex's own FUSE handle can see the file - checking from the host can
pass while Plex's view fails.
