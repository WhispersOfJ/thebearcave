"""Rename fish commands across every file that names one as a string.

Phase 8b of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-cli-naming-cleanup-design.md.

Hard cutover: no aliases, no transition period. Every reference moves in one
commit, and the script proves it by grepping for each old name afterwards.

Usage:
