# Usage: stack-watchstate-history [title] [limit]
# Watch history WatchState has recorded, newest first. With a title given it
# filters to matching titles (partial names work); with none it shows the most
# recent items across everything.
#
# Every row carries `via` (which backend reported it) and `updated_at`, which
# is how a webhook-delivered event is told apart from one the scheduled import
# picked up.
