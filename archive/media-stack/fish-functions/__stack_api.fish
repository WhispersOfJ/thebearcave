# Private helper: call Control Panel's API (direct port, no Traefik/Authelia
# in front of it anymore) and print its `message` field. Works against both
# response shapes app.py returns: {"ok","message",...} on 2xx, and FastAPI's
# {"detail": {"ok","message",...}} wrapper on a raised HTTPException.
# Usage: __stack_api METHOD PATH [JSON_BODY]
# Exit status mirrors the API's own "ok" field (or the HTTP status if the
# body isn't JSON at all).
#
# Sends X-Api-Key from CONTROL_PANEL_SERVICE_API_KEY (media-stack/.env) on
# every call. app.py (still live as of Phase 3 of
# .claude/plans/evolved-control-panel-backend.plan.md) ignores unknown
# headers, so this is a no-op today - it's here so every stack-* command
# keeps working the moment the evolved backend (main.py, real auth) cuts
# over in Phase 5, instead of every one of them silently 401ing that day.
