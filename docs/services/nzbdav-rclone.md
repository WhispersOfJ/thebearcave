# nzbdav_rclone (FUSE sidecar)

`nzbdav_rclone` mounts InfiniDysk’s WebDAV tree at `/mnt/remote/nzbdav`. It is the
mount owner for Radarr, Sonarr, Plex, and Unpackerr.

| Network | `bearcave` |
| Published ports | none; RC API is internal on `:5572` |
| Config | `config/nzbdav-rclone/rclone.conf` and `cache/` |

## Mount contract

The sidecar mounts `/mnt/remote` as `rshared`, clears stale FUSE state before startup,
and uses a full VFS cache capped at 50 GiB. The container has a 3 GiB memory
cap because the active cache workload reached roughly 2 GiB; the cache itself is
disk-backed. The mount is tuned for a large, mostly immutable media tree: 32 MiB
read chunks, 32 MiB read-ahead, fast fingerprints, 30-second attribute caching,
and a six-hour directory cache.
Consumers receive
`/mnt/remote/nzbdav` with `rslave` propagation.

`config/nzbdav-rclone/rclone.conf` must contain:

```ini
[nzbdav]
type = webdav
url = http://nzbdav:3000/
vendor = other
user = usenet
pass = <rclone-obscured WebDAV password>
```

Generate the password with `rclone obscure`; never put the plaintext password in the
config file or repository.

## Recovery

If the mount is unavailable:

```bash
docker compose restart nzbdav nzbdav_rclone
docker exec nzbdav_rclone mountpoint -q /mnt/remote/nzbdav
docker compose restart radarr sonarr plex unpackerr
```

Never scan Plex while this mount is down. A scan during a dead FUSE window can create
red trash cans and mark known media as deleted.
