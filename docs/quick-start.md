# Quick Start

Get The Bear Cave running from zero to streaming with the eight-service stack.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Linux host with Docker Engine 24+ and Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- `/dev/fuse` available for the rclone sidecar
- At least one Usenet provider (host, port, username, password)
- Optional Intel/AMD GPU exposed as `/dev/dri` for Plex hardware transcoding

Docker Desktop for macOS/Windows is not supported: FUSE and Plex host networking
are Linux-specific requirements.

## 2. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WhispersOfJ/thebearcave.git
cd thebearcave
cp .env.template .env
nano .env
```

Set real values for `HOST_IP`, Plex and *arr API keys, `FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY`,
WebDAV credentials, `NZBDAV_PROFILE_TOKEN`, and both Usenet provider blocks. The
backup provider values may be retained as placeholders only if you intentionally
run a single provider.

The rclone remote in `config/nzbdav-rclone/rclone.conf` must use an rclone-obscured
password. Generate one with:

```bash
rclone obscure "your-webdav-password"
```

## 3. Validate and start

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh --validate-only
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Startup order is Prowlarr → NzbDAV → rclone FUSE mount → Radarr/Sonarr/Plex/Unpackerr.
Seerr starts independently and sends requests to Radarr and Sonarr.

## 4. Configure the applications

### Plex

Open `http://HOST_IP:32400/web`, claim the server, and use these library roots:

- `/data/movies` for movies
- `/data/shows` for TV

The media roots contain symlinks into the WebDAV-backed FUSE mount. Confirm the
mount before scanning:

```bash
docker exec nzbdav_rclone mountpoint -q /mnt/remote/nzbdav && echo "MOUNT OK"
```

### Radarr and Sonarr

Open `http://HOST_IP:7878` and `http://HOST_IP:8989`.

1. Add InfiniDysk as the SABnzbd-compatible download client at `nzbdav:3000`.
2. Use `FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY` as the download-client API key.
3. Use `/data/movies` and `/data/shows` as the root folders.
4. Confirm the generated application API keys match `.env`.
5. Prowlarr syncs indexers to both applications.

### Seerr

Open `http://HOST_IP:5055`, complete setup, then connect Plex, Radarr, and Sonarr.

## 5. Verify

```bash
./tests/health/run-all.sh
./tests/integration/test_pipeline.sh --dry-run
python3 scripts/check_mount_drift.py
```

For the critical path, verify the authenticated queue is empty or inspect it with:

```bash
KEY=$(grep '^FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api?mode=queue&output=json&apikey=$KEY"
```

## 6. Plex stale-mount recovery

If Plex shows red trash cans or missing seasons/files:

1. Stop rescans while the mount is unhealthy.
2. Confirm `mountpoint -q /mnt/remote/nzbdav` succeeds.
3. Restart Plex after the mount is restored.
4. Trigger a full scan with `stack-plex scan` or from the Plex UI.
5. Empty the Plex trash only after confirming the expected files are visible.

## Operational notes

- All services use direct host ports; there is no reverse proxy or HTTPS layer.
- `nzbdav` queue state is not persistent across container recreation. Do not recreate
  it until the queue is empty, or explicitly use the dangerous `--force` path.
- `nzbdav_rclone` is the mount owner. Its restart cascades to the four FUSE consumers.
- See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [docs/landmines.md](landmines.md), and the per-service
  pages for recovery procedures.
