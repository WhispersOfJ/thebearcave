# Troubleshooting

Start with the first unhealthy component in dependency order. The active stack is:
Prowlarr → NzbDAV → rclone FUSE mount → Radarr/Sonarr/Plex/Unpackerr, with Seerr
providing requests.

## Everything is unhealthy

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose config --quiet
df -h
```

Check the first failure in this order:

1. `prowlarr` and `nzbdav` healthchecks
2. `nzbdav_rclone` mount health
3. Radarr/Sonarr/Plex/Unpackerr
4. Seerr

## Plex shows red trash cans or missing files

This is usually a scan performed while the FUSE mount was unavailable. Do not empty
trash or rescan until the mount is healthy:

```bash
docker exec nzbdav_rclone mountpoint -q /mnt/remote/nzbdav
docker exec nzbdav_rclone ls /mnt/remote/nzbdav | head
```

Recovery:

```bash
docker compose restart nzbdav nzbdav_rclone
# Wait for the mount healthcheck, then restart consumers.
docker compose restart radarr sonarr plex unpackerr
# Trigger a Plex library scan, then empty trash only after expected files reappear.
```

## Mount gone while the container is Up

The rclone process can fail between Docker restarts. The mountpoint check is authoritative:

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' nzbdav_rclone
docker logs --tail=100 nzbdav_rclone
```

The rclone entrypoint clears stale FUSE state before mounting. If it still loops, check
for stale host mounts and follow the FUSE recovery procedure in
[docs/services/nzbdav-rclone.md](../services/nzbdav-rclone.md).

## NzbDAV returns 401

Verify both the running environment and the client key:

```bash
docker exec nzbdav env | grep FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY
grep '^FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY=' .env
```

Radarr and Sonarr must use the same value as `FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY`. NzbDAV’s WebDAV
remote uses the credentials in `config/nzbdav-rclone/rclone.conf`.

## NzbDAV queue is not accessible

```bash
KEY=$(grep '^FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api?mode=queue&output=json&apikey=$KEY"
```

Do not recreate NzbDAV while the queue is unknown. Use
`scripts/check_nzbdav_queue.py` or the guarded update script first.

## Radarr/Sonarr imports are stuck

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100 radarr sonarr nzbdav unpackerr
docker exec nzbdav_rclone ls /mnt/remote/nzbdav/completed-symlinks | head
```

Confirm the download client is `nzbdav:3000`, the API key matches, the FUSE mount is
healthy, and the root folders are `/data/movies` and `/data/shows`.

For *arr items stuck in the queue as completed (including the "matched by ID —
manual import required" class, where auto-import is impossible by design), drain
them through the manual-import path with `scripts/drain_sonarr_queue.py` (dry-run
by default; `--apply` acts). The script serves both apps via `--app`
(`sonarr` default, `radarr` supported); the matching `$SONARR_API_KEY` /
`$RADARR_API_KEY` env var is used when `--api-key` is omitted:

```bash
python3 scripts/drain_sonarr_queue.py                      # sonarr dry-run (default)
python3 scripts/drain_sonarr_queue.py --app radarr         # radarr dry-run
python3 scripts/drain_sonarr_queue.py --apply --limit 10   # act on sonarr
python3 scripts/drain_sonarr_queue.py --app radarr --apply --limit 10 # act on radarr
python3 scripts/drain_sonarr_queue.py --apply --auto-safe  # provable items only
```

`--auto-safe` restricts imports to items whose file name parses unambiguously to
 the queue item's own series/movie (re-checked through the *arr's parse API,
 since the manual-import preview trusts the grab history — the same claim the
 auto-import guard refuses for "matched by ID" items). Anything unprovable is
 left queued for manual review, never removed.
### Bulk "Search Missing" sweeps grab wrong shows — search scoped instead

A whole-series or whole-library "Search Missing" blast sends every missing
episode through the indexer at once and auto-grabs whatever comes back.
Releases whose titles don't parse to the searched series fall back to the
"matched by ID" path at grab time (the *arr uses the search criteria's TVDb
ID when the title won't match), which auto-import refuses — the 2026-09-01
sweep left 230 stuck items, ~190 GB of which was later mis-imported as
wrong-show content (ARK into Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series, The
Sticky into The Tick, the 2022 Staircase dramatization into the 2004
documentary).

Prefer `scripts/search_missing_scoped.py` for any sweep: it searches the
same way Sonarr does internally (per series/season) but in small batches
(`--batch 20`), pauses between batches (`--gap 60`), stops for review after
each batch unless `--yes`, and `--verify` re-parses every new queue item's
title and aborts the sweep — rc 2 — the moment anything is NO_MATCH or a
different series than the one searched. Applied runs persist an atomic
`~/.local/state/thebearcave/search-missing-scoped.json` checkpoint before
posting (override it with `--checkpoint-path`). After the review stop, continue
only with the same scope and options plus explicit `--resume`;
completed and verified groups are skipped, while corrupt or ambiguous state
fails closed without posting. Dry-run by default; only `--apply` POSTs search
commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/search_missing_scoped.py --series 25891                  # dry-run, one series
python3 scripts/search_missing_scoped.py --all --batch 10                # dry-run, whole library
python3 scripts/search_missing_scoped.py --series 25891 --apply --verify  # scoped sweep + guard
python3 scripts/search_missing_scoped.py --series 25891 --apply --verify --resume
python3 scripts/search_missing_scoped.py --all --apply --yes             # no checkpoints
```

Manually: search one series at a time (never the whole Wanted list) and
check the queue between series; prefer season-scoped searches, whose
season packs tend to title-match cleanly. If a checkpoint reports an
ambiguous group with no command ID, stop and inspect it rather than deleting
or editing the file: Sonarr cannot prove whether that POST reached the
server, so the wrapper intentionally refuses to guess.

The executable interface in `scripts/search_missing_scoped.py` only parses
arguments and renders results. `scripts/search_missing_scoped_core.py` owns
Sonarr planning, command lifecycle, and verification; the atomic state-file
logic lives in `scripts/search_missing_scoped_checkpoint.py`.

Three title variants from the Sep-1 burst are *genuine* scene-mapping
candidates — right content under a variant title. Adding them to the shared
scene-mapping dataset makes future grabs title-match and auto-import:

* `Chirurgiens.D.Exception` → The Surgeon's Cut (French title)
* `Trailer.Park.Boys.Out.of.the.Park.Europe` → Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park
* `Transformers.War.For.Cybertron.Trilogy.Earthrise` → Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy

When a bad grab still lands, the backstop is the drain's safe mode:
`drain_sonarr_queue.py --apply --auto-safe` imports only queue items whose
file parses provably to their own series and leaves everything else queued
for manual review.

## Seerr requests do not download

Check Seerr’s connections to Plex, Radarr, and Sonarr, then inspect the relevant *arr
queue and NzbDAV queue. Seerr itself should respond at `http://HOST_IP:5055`.

## Hardware transcoding falls back to software

```bash
docker exec plex ls -l /dev/dri
```

Plex Pass, GPU drivers, `/dev/dri`, and hardware acceleration in Plex settings are
required. Library scans still use CPU even when playback uses VAAPI.

## Container will not stop

Plex has a required 90-second grace period. Give it time before escalating:

```bash
docker stop -t 90 plex
```

For a wedged FUSE handle, restore/restart the mount owner first, then restart consumers.

## Escalation order

1. `docker compose ps`
2. Check the NzbDAV queue before any recreate.
3. Check the FUSE mount before any Plex scan.
4. Inspect logs for the first unhealthy service.
5. Restore from backup before destructive cleanup; see
   [backup & restore](backup-restore.md).
