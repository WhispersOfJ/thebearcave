# Cave Deck — Specification

**Status:** Draft v1 (pre-implementation, interview-complete)
**Date:** 2026-09-06
**Supersedes:** the interactive operational surface of `cave-scripts-spec.md` (Cave-Scripts submodule), the `stack-*`/`cave-*` bash functions, the fish host tools, the waybar integration, and `stack-tui`.

---

## 1. Goal

Replace every interactive interface to The Bear Cave stack — the TUI (`stack-tui`), all `stack-*`/`cave-*` bash functions, the fish host tools, and the waybar integration — with a single sleek, fast, themeable, responsive **web application: Cave Deck**.

Cave Deck can do *anything and everything the stack needs*:

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Full ops parity** | Every one of the ~110 bash + 25 fish functions has a GUI equivalent at v1 (§6). **Row-level mapping: Appendix C is authoritative** — it enumerates every function, its GUI feature ID, and its live-harness safety class |
| **Switching APIs** | A credentials/API-sources control panel: rotate *arr/Seerr/Plex/nzbdav keys, edit Usenet provider blocks, manage Prowlarr indexer credentials, switch list sources (TMDb/MDBList/IMDb) (§6.4) |
| **Writing to `.env`** | Validated env editor with diff preview, secret masking, and prompted apply cascades (§6.5) |
| **Unsticking media** | Interactive import-decision UI for blocked/pending imports (§6.6) |
| **Adding containers** | A researched catalog of **100 curated containers** that deploys compose-natively through automated PRs (§6.3) |

**Explicitly ruled out:** FastAPI (backend is Rust), auth flows (LAN-only owner trust), multi-host management, guest/read-only modes.

---

## 2. What is being replaced (the removal inventory)

All of the following are **deleted** when Cave Deck reaches v1 parity ("full removal" decision):

### 2.1 In `thebearcave` repo
| Item | Location today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bash functions | `services/bash-functions/functions/` — 18 files, ~3,463 lines, **110+ functions** (`stack-*`, `__helpers`) | The primary operational surface |
| Bash loader | `services/bash-functions/bearcave-bash.sh` (`.bashrc` source line, env loader) | Reads `.env` literally today — its quirks die with it |
| Completions | `services/bash-functions/completions/stack-completions.sh` (generated) | |
| TUI launcher | `services/bash-functions/scripts/stack-tui`, `stack-tui-toggle.sh` | Waybar-toggled terminal launcher |
| Python-backed CLI helpers | `services/bash-functions/scripts/` (python gates invoked from functions) | Logic ports to Rust (§4.3) |
| Fish host tools | `services/host-tools/functions/*.fish` — 25 files (~265 lines) | Already not loaded on this host; removed from repo |
| Waybar integration | `services/bash-functions/waybar/` (config, style.css, record/nightlight/stack-tui scripts) + `check_waybar_drift.py`/tests | Replaced by Cave Deck's persistent status strip (§6.1.4) |
| Safe-command registry | `tests/live/safe_command_registry.yaml`, `tests/live/run_safe_matrix.sh`, `tests/live/registry.py` | The bash/fish parity harness loses its subject |
| Submodule | `services/cave-scripts` (`.gitmodules` entry) | Unpinned; its spec docs archived per retirement record |
| CI checks | `check_waybar_drift.py`, `check_stack_tui.py` (if present), live-matrix jobs, waybar-drift workflow steps | |
| **Python scripts** | `scripts/*.py` gates/checks/NOTIFIERs that exist solely as function backends | **Port everything to Rust** (§4.3); repo-internal CI-only scripts (compose validators, audit_residue) are evaluated per-script during implementation — anything the GUI needs is ported, anything CI needs stays |

### 2.2 On the host
- `~/.bashrc` loader line for `bearcave-bash.sh`
- `~/.config/fish/functions/stack-*.fish` symlinks (if ever reinstalled)
- `~/.config/waybar/scripts/stack-tui-toggle.sh` and friends (weather/updates/cava/gpu-usage stay **out of scope** — host-only dotfiles, not repo-managed)
- Nightly reclaim cron entry (`install-nightly-reclaim-cron.sh`) — replaced by Cave Deck's scheduler (§6.9)

### 2.3 What is NOT removed
- `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`/`.env.template`, `secrets/` — Cave Deck *manages* these, never replaces them
- Historical records: `CHANGELOG.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `TODO.md`, lifecycle retirement records
- `archive/` (reference material)
- The landmines in `AGENTS.md` — they become **enforced invariants in the Rust backend** (§7)

---

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Repository & deployment model ("Separate repo" + "Hybrid")

```
WhispersOfJ/cave-deck          (new repo — own CI, own releases)
├── backend/                   Rust (axum) — single static binary
├── frontend/                  React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
├── catalog/catalog.yaml       The 100-container curated catalog (§6.3)
├── spec/                      This spec's living copy + ADRs
└── .github/workflows/         CI: test, lint, build, release
```

- `thebearcave` pins `cave-deck` as a **submodule** at `services/cave-deck` (same pattern as the retiring `cave-scripts`), and carries the compose service + host-tools replacement records.
- **Compose service** `cave-deck`: container on `bearcave`, published port **7780** (chosen; free on host, not in the port map), `mem_limit: 512m`, healthchecked, binds `docker.sock` (read-write — it manages containers) plus the repo-root bind mounts it needs (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, `media/`, `config/` read paths).
- **Host systemd shim** (`cave-deck-host.service`, user-level): a minimal privileged helper the backend calls over a localhost Unix socket for operations the container cannot do: ufw rule edits, host package diagnostics (pacman, SMART, journalctl), filesystem paths outside bind mounts, systemctl timers. The shim is a thin, auditable command allowlist — no general shell.
- Update flow: new Cave Deck release → PR bumps the submodule pin in `thebearcave` (same automated-PR flow it uses for everything else).

### 3.2 Backend: Rust

- **Framework:** axum + tokio. Static binary, containerized (multi-stage Distroless/Alpine), target < 50 MB RSS idle.
- **Docker:** `bollard` (native Docker Engine API client over `docker.sock`).
- **Realtime:** WebSocket hub (tokio-tungstenite native in axum) — §5.3.
- **HTTP clients:** reqwest to the *arr/Plex/Seerr/nzbdav APIs (base URLs from `.env`, keys from `.env`/config).
- **Persistence:** SQLite via `sqlx` — one `cave-deck.db` in `config/cave-deck/` (§5.4).
- **Config/secret access:** reads/writes `.env` and `secrets/` through the same bind mounts compose uses; every write validated then atomically staged (§6.5).
- **Process supervision:** systemd `Restart=on-failure`; compose healthcheck hits `/api/healthz`.

### 3.3 Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

- React 18, TypeScript strict, Vite build, TanStack Query for request caching, Tailwind CSS with a token layer for theming.
- **API contract:** the Rust backend serves OpenAPI (utoipa) and the frontend generates a typed client from it — one source of truth, no drift.
- **Theming:** preset themes + dark/light toggle (§5.5). Implementation: CSS custom properties under a `data-theme` attribute; presets shipped as token files; choice persisted in localStorage + backend profile.
- **Responsiveness:** desktop-first layouts that degrade cleanly to phone width (TanStack Query + view transitions; tables become cards under 768px). Touch targets ≥ 44px on mobile.
- Served by the Rust binary as embedded static assets (single-binary deployment; no separate web server).

### 3.4 Network & security posture

- **LAN-only, no login** (owner-trust model, consistent with the rest of the stack).
- ufw rule: `allow from <owner-subnet> to any port 7780 proto tcp` (installed via the host shim during setup; the general bridge-subnet deny stays).
- No TLS (LAN HTTP like every other service here). The backend binds `0.0.0.0:7780` inside the container; exposure is controlled exclusively by ufw.
- CSRF surface: same-origin only; WebSocket origin-checked against the configured host IP.
- Audit log records the caller IP for every mutating action (§5.4).

## 4. Data flows & integration map

### 4.1 Surfaces Cave Deck talks to
| Surface | Protocol | Credential source | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docker | Unix socket API | socket perms | containers, images, stats, events, compose-apply |
| Radarr / Sonarr | REST `/api/v3` | `RADARR_API_KEY`, `SONARR_API_KEY` | queues, imports, series/movies, health, blocklist, calendars |
| Prowlarr | REST `/api/v1` | `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | indexers, applications sync, tests |
| Seerr | REST `/api/v1` | `SEERR_API_KEY` | requests, settings |
| Plex | REST | `PLEX_TOKEN` | sessions, libraries, Butler tasks, analysis, markers |
| NzbDAV (InfiniDysk) | SABnzbd-style `/api` | `FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY` | queue, history, stats, add/cancel |
| rclone RC | `:5572` | `NZBDAV_RCLONE_RC_PASS` | mount status, VFS stats |
| Host | Unix socket → shim | — | ufw, pacman, journalctl, SMART, timers, paths |
| GitHub | `gh` CLI on host shim (or token) | existing gh auth | automated PR flow (§6.3.4) |
| Discord | webhook | `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | notifications (§6.8) |
| SMTP | `smtp.gmail.com:587` | `.env` `CAVE_DECK_SMTP_USER` + App Password | email digests (§6.8) |

### 4.2 The compose-is-truth principle
Every persistent change Cave Deck makes to the stack (new container, edited env, changed volume) lands as a **tracked change in `thebearcave` git** via automated PR. The GUI never leaves drift between what runs and what's committed.

### 4.3 Python reuse decision — "Port everything"
All function/script logic needed by Cave Deck is reimplemented natively in Rust and the Python originals are retired with the bash functions. Porting order is risk-ordered (§9); each ported op carries the original script's tests as Rust unit tests (the Python test files are the behavioral spec — e.g. `drain_sonarr_queue` semantics, `check_radarr_db_size` gate math, `maintenance_digest` finding levels).

CI-internal-only scripts in `thebearcave` (compose validators, audit_residue, secret manifest checks) **stay Python** — they validate the repo, not the running stack, and are not part of the GUI's job.

---

## 5. Non-functional requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- First contentful paint < 1s on LAN; route transitions < 100ms (SPA, prefetched data).
- Backend API p99 < 50ms for cached reads; live Docker stats sampled 1s and pushed as deltas.
- The backend must stay responsive while any long operation runs — all mutations are jobs (§5.2), never blocking the request path.

### 5.2 Job engine
Every mutating action (recreate, prune, search, import decision, env apply, catalog deploy) is a **job**: queued, cancellable, progress-reported over WebSocket, audit-logged, and idempotent where the underlying API allows. Jobs survive page reloads (server-side state). Concurrency: mutating jobs on the same target serialize; reads never block.

### 5.3 WebSocket topics
| Topic | Payload cadence |
|---|---|
| `docker.stats` | 1s per-container CPU/mem/net deltas |
| `docker.events` | as they occur (die/stop/oom/health_status) |
| `queue.arr` | on change (Sonarr/Radarr merged queue view) |
| `queue.nzbdav` | on change (download queue + speeds) |
| `mount.health` | 10s (mountpoint check, VFS stats, error counters) |
| `jobs` | job state transitions + progress |
| `logs.<container>` | live tail with filter (e.g. `logs.sonarr level=warn`) |
| `plex.sessions` | on change |
| `system.host` | 10s (mem/disk/load, from shim) |

Client auto-reconnects with exponential backoff and resyncs via a `snapshot` message per topic.

### 5.4 SQLite schema (cave-deck.db)
- `events(id, ts, kind, source, severity, message, json)` — stack event history (imports, failures, guard trips, job results)
- `audit(id, ts, actor_ip, action, target, params_json, job_id, outcome)` — every mutation
- `metrics(ts, container, cpu_pct, mem_bytes, rx_bps, tx_bps)` — rolling samples; retention 30d (auto-prune)
- `list_checkpoints(kind, key, state_json, updated_at)` — Letterboxd/MDBList import resume state (replaces `search_missing_scoped_checkpoint.py` behavior)
- `settings(key, value)` — theme choice, dashboard prefs, digest schedule
- WAL mode; file lives in `config/cave-deck/` so the existing backup manifest covers it (one line added to `backup.sh`'s service list).

### 5.5 Theming
- 6+ shipped presets (including a Bear Cave dark default, a light theme, and a high-contrast one), switchable instantly.
- Tokens: color scales, accent, fonts, radius, density, sidebar width.
- Preset = JSON token file in `frontend/themes/`; import/export in settings (no code needed to add themes).

## 6. Feature areas (v1 = full parity)

### 6.1 Dashboard & status
1. **Stack overview**: 8 containers + cave-deck — health, uptime, restarts, mem/CPU live, port links. Replaces `stack-status`, `stack-top`, `stack-version`.
2. **At-a-glance rows**: FUSE mount health (replaces `stack-mount-health`), nzbdav queue depth/speed (`stack-nzbdav-queue/stats`), Sonarr/Radarr queue counts (`stack-queue-status`), disk free (`stack-disk-free`/`stack-docker-disk-usage`), recent imports (`stack-arr-recently-added`, `stack-plex-recently-added`), Seerr open requests (`stack-seerr-requests`, `stack-requests`).
3. **Activity feed**: merged live events (WebSocket) + persisted history — replaces `stack-activity-feed`, `stack-arrivals`, `stack-recent`.
4. **Persistent mini status strip**: the waybar replacement — a slim always-visible bar in the app (mount state, queue depth, disk, alerts) that can also be popped out into a small always-on-top browser window ( Picture-in-Picture-style) for desktop display.

### 6.2 Containers
- **Lifecycle**: start/stop/restart/recreate(compose)/remove, with compose-aware dependency ordering (e.g. recreate nzbdav → rclone → dependents). Replaces `stack-container`, `stack-restart-all`.
- **Logs**: live tail any container, severity filter, download.
- **Stats**: per-container CPU/mem/net history charts (from `metrics`).
- **Images**: list, check upstream updates (`stack-image-check`), pull with progress, prune (`stack-disk-reclaim` docker leg).
- **Compose file view**: read-only rendering of the effective compose config with links to edit flows (env §6.5, catalog §6.3).

### 6.3 Container catalog (100 curated entries)
- **Curation:** implementation begins with AI-assisted research producing `catalog/catalog.yaml` — exactly **100 entries** across the four chosen categories, each verified against current upstream images:
  - *Media pipeline* (~35): *arr family (Lidarr, Readarr, Whisparr, Prowlarr-adjacent tools), Audiobookshelf, Navidrome, Kavita/Calibre-web, Tautulli, Overseerr-likes, subtitle tools, metadata agents
  - *Ops & monitoring* (~25): Dozzle, Glances, Netdata, Uptime Kuma-class, Scrutiny, cAdvisor-class, log viewers
  - *Network & security* (~20): AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, WireGuard/Tailscale, Vaultwarden, Caddy/NPM, crowdsec-class
  - *Productivity & home* (~20): Paperless-ngx, Immich, PhotoPrism, Nextcloud, Homarr, Homepage, Gitea/Forgejo, Jellyfin
- **Entry schema** (tracked, reviewable diff per catalog PR):
  ```yaml
  - id: navidrome
    name: Navidrome
    category: media
    retired: false          # false = not on thebearcave's retired registry
    image: ghcr.io/navidrome/navidrome:latest   # pinned digest option
    ports: ["4533:4533"]
    volumes: ["./config/navidrome:/data", "./media/music:/music:ro"]
    env: [{key: ND_SCANSCHEDULE, default: "1h"}]
    compose_fragment: |     # rendered into docker-compose.yml on install
      navidrome:
        <<: *common
        ...
    checks: {healthcheck: "...", docs: "https://..."}
    notes: "requires media/music to exist; add Plex library afterwards"
  ```
- **Retired-services policy: exclude entirely.** Anything on `thebearcave`'s `RETIRED_SERVICES` registry (lidarr, readarr, audiobookshelf, komga, adguard, crowdsec, vaultwarden, watchstate, uptime-kuma, n8n, cleanuparr, arr-dashboard, metacache, …) **never appears** in the catalog. The catalog build step cross-checks against `audit_residue.py`'s registry and CI fails if a retired name leaks in.
- **Install flow (compose-native, automated PR):**
  1. User picks a container → GUI renders the form from the entry schema (ports/env/volumes editable, conflict detection against the live port map).
  2. Cave Deck creates a branch `add-<id>` in `thebearcave`, appends the compose fragment (alphabetical, section-commented), adds config dirs to `validate.sh`'s list if needed, commits, pushes, opens a PR via `gh`, enables auto-merge.
  3. On merge: backend pulls main, runs `docker compose up -d <service>`, verifies health, and reports the result as a job + Discord/email event.
  4. Uninstall = same flow in reverse (removal PR), with a data-keeping choice (config dir retained or deleted).
- **Conflict rules:** port collisions (checked live + against compose), volume path overlap, memory-budget check (host 22 GiB vs current caps), name collisions with compose service/container names.

### 6.4 Credentials & API sources ("switching API" — all of it)
- ***arr / Seerr keys*: rotate Radarr/Sonarr/Prowlarr/Seerr API keys (generate new in-app, POST to each app, update `.env`, recompute dependents: nzbdav + unpackerr env, recyclarr secrets, Prowlarr application sync re-push). Replaces the manual config.xml extraction dance.
- **Plex**: token verification, `PLEX_CLAIM` first-run flow (the compose gap is fixed in `thebearcave` alongside), library token health.
- **Usenet providers**: full CRUD on the `NZBDAV_CONFIG__USENET__PROVIDERS` JSON (host/user/pass/conns/ssl) — incl. **enable/disable per provider** (the Eweka pattern), with a live credential **test** button (DNS→TCP→TLS→AUTHINFO probe, same as the manual test used during onboarding) and connections budget sum vs plan.
- **Indexer credentials**: Prowlarr indexer API keys, per-indexer enable, test, VIP expiry fields surfaced.
- **List sources**: switch import-list metadata source (TMDb/MDBList/IMDb) and credentials for the list-import flows (§6.7).
- **Secrets visibility: reveal on click** — every value masked by default; per-value reveal (auto re-masks after 15s); each reveal is audit-logged.
- Every credential change computes the **blast radius** (which consumers read that var) and routes through the §6.5 apply flow.

### 6.5 `.env` editor & apply engine ("writing to the .env")
- **View**: grouped like the template (identity, internal secrets, providers, arr keys, notification), masked values, `changeme`/stale detection (`__bearcave_warn_stale_keys` behavior, ported).
- **Edit**: validated inputs per var type (port ranges, URLs, hex keys, cron expressions); inline docs from `.env.template` comments; diff preview before save.
- **Apply ("Prompted apply")**:
  1. Backend computes affected services from a var→consumer map (e.g. `SONARR_API_KEY` → sonarr, nzbdav, unpackerr, recyclarr-secrets).
  2. For any recreate touching **nzbdav**, the **queue-empty guard** runs first (landmine #4) — if the queue is non-empty the apply is blocked with the live queue shown.
  3. One user click → writes `.env` atomically (with backup copy), regenerates derived files (recyclarr secrets.yml), recreates services in dependency order, verifies health, reports the cascade.
- **Validation parity**: the GUI runs the same checks as `setup.sh --validate-only` (ported) so a saved `.env` is always compose-valid.

### 6.6 Unstick media ("Import decision UI")
- **Stuck views**: Sonarr/Radarr queues filtered to `importBlocked` / `importPending` / `warning` with the full status messages (the ID-mismatch, missing-episode, sample-check messages). Replaces `stack-arr-queue-errors`, `stack-queue-autofix` manual runs.
- **Decision UI per item** (interactive, like Sonarr's manual import):
  - **Map**: choose the correct series/season/episode (search-assisted) — solves wrong-series grabs (the Live Untucked case).
  - **Override**: force import despite ID-match warnings, with explicit confirmation.
  - **Delete + re-search**: remove from client, optionally blocklist, trigger episode/season search.
  - **Bulk**: select-all-same-cause actions.
- **Guard rails**: recreates triggered from here still respect landmine #4; blocklist default follows Sonarr semantics (on for bad releases, off for wrong-series valid releases — the exact distinction handled manually during the Drag Race wave).
- Backlog surfacing: `stack-arr-backlog`, `stack-backlog-status`, `stack-arr-missing-aired`, `stack-cutoff-unmet` become filterable library-health views with one-click scoped searches (the `search_missing_scoped*` behavior, ported).

### 6.7 Library & list tools (full parity)
- **List imports**: Letterboxd (`stack-letterboxd-*`: import/track/tracked/untrack/history) and MDBList (`stack-mdblist-*`) management UIs; tracked lists table with per-item state, resume checkpoints persisted (§5.4); `stack-import-lists`, `stack-arr-import(-all/-candidates/-starvation)`, `stack-loop-candidates/exclude/unmonitor`, `stack-loop-ratings`, `stack-rating-imdb/mdblist` all have equivalents.
- **Watchable**: `stack-watchable`, `stack-unwatched`, `__watchable_*` — Plex-backed "what can we watch" views with Seerr availability cross-reference.
- **Sonarr/Radarr library health**: monitoring fixes (`stack-sonarr-fix-episode-monitoring`), series/episode toggles (`stack-arr-toggle-search`), blocklist view/clear (`stack-arr-blocklist/-clear-blocklist`), health & logs (`stack-radarr-health`, `stack-arr-logs`, `stack-log-levels`), DB prune buttons (`stack-radarr-prune`/`stack-sonarr-prune` — full backup → prune → vacuum → verify flow as a job).
- **Import-lists overview** (`stack-import-lists`), config sizes (`stack-disk-config-sizes`), OOM/perms checks (`stack-oom-check`, `stack-perms-check`).

### 6.8 Plex suite (all `stack-plex-*`)
- Sessions (live), libraries list, refresh/scan, empty trash (with the red-trash-can landmine check: mount verified healthy *before* allowing the rescan+empty sequence), analyze/deep-analysis/loudness/music analysis, markers (intro/credits/chapters/ad) generate + view, media index, voice activity, butler tasks (all/single), database backup, cache/log cleanup, image clean (idle-gated), EPG refresh, automatic-updates toggle. Each as a job with progress.

### 6.9 Host tools (via shim) + scheduling + notifications
- **Host diagnostics**: pacman updates/orphans/cache (`stack-pkg-*`), journal errors/size (`stack-journal-*`), failed units (`stack-service-failed`), zombies (`stack-zombie-check`), mem pressure, SMART/btrfs (`stack-disk-health`), reboot/kernel pending (`stack-reboot-check`, `stack-kernel-check`), SSH doctor, AUR audit, uptime report, flatpak updates, git status across repos (`stack-git-status-all`), firewall status, cron/timer listing (`stack-cron-list`, `stack-timer-status`), worktree status (`stack-worktree`), config/secret/mount drift (`stack-config-drift` + ported check scripts), audit residue view (`stack-audit-residue`), Claude backup (`stack-claude-full-backup`).
- **Maintenance digest**: the monthly digest (`maintenance_digest.py`) becomes a scheduled Cave Deck job (DB gates radarr/sonarr, nzbdav queue, import-queue depth, host checks) delivered **in-app + Discord + email**; nightly reclaim cron replaced by an internal scheduler (same guarded reclaim logic).
- **Notifications**:
  - **In-app**: activity feed + toasts (always).
  - **Discord**: the existing webhook; events (imports, failures, guard trips, job completions, digest) post as embeds. Replaces `arrival_notifier`/`notify-test` Discord legs.
  - **Email digest**: scheduled summary via **Gmail + App Password** (`smtp.gmail.com:587`, STARTTLS; creds in `.env`: `CAVE_DECK_SMTP_USER`, `CAVE_DECK_SMTP_PASS` — App Password instructions linked in settings; `CAVE_DECK_SMTP_TO` for recipients). Daily or weekly digest cadence selectable; includes overnight arrivals, stuck items, gate failures, pending updates.
- **nzbdav tools**: queue view/cancel, history, stats, dedup check, delete-failures (`stack-nzbdav-*`), and the **safe recreate** flow (`nzbdav-safe-recreate.sh` logic: confirm pending 0 → recreate → verify frontend + authenticated API + PROPFIND health — the landmine #13 triple check).

---

## 7. Landmine enforcement (invariants in code)

The AGENTS.md landmines become runtime guards — the backend **refuses** unsafe operations with a human explanation (two-step confirm dialog shows the guard result):

| # | Landmine | Cave Deck enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bind-mount staleness | Any edit to a bind-mounted file via the env editor flags "restart required" and offers the guarded recreate |
| 2 | FUSE mount fragility | Never umounts; recreate cascade = owner (nzbdav_rclone) then dependents in order; mount-health check before any Plex trash-empty |
| 3 | Plex grace period | Compose apply never shortens `stop_grace_period`; plex recreates wait for clean stop |
| 4 | NzbDAV queue non-persistence | **Hard guard**: any nzbdav recreate requires authenticated queue==0 check; block + show queue otherwise |
| 5 | Plex host network | Catalog/apply validation refuses bridge-network plex edits |
| 6 | rclone obscure | Provider writes that touch rclone.conf run `rclone obscure` server-side; plaintext never written |
| 7 | Exhaustive removal checklists | Removals in `thebearcave` go through the same automated-PR flow with a checklist template |
| 8 | Radarr orphaned profiles | Post-profile-delete verification job (`check_radarr_profiles` port) offered after any quality-profile action |
| 9 | SQLite bloat | DB-size gates on dashboard; prune flows built-in (§6.7) |
| 10 | ImageMaid path validation | If ImageMaid is ever run from catalog, the PhotoTranscoder path warning is built into its form |
| 13 | Frontend-masks-backend | nzbdav health = `/healthz` + authenticated queue API + PROPFIND triple check before "healthy" is displayed |

---

## 8. CI/CD (cave-deck repo)

- **Worktree discipline** carries over: all changes on task worktrees, PRs only, linear history, squash.
- CI: `cargo test/clippy/fmt`, `cargo audit`, `vitest` + `tsc --noEmit` for frontend, Playwright smoke (dashboard renders, one job per feature area) against a compose test-profile, `actionlint`, SHA-pinned actions, gitleaks, Trivy on the built image.
- Releases: release-please; images published to GHCR by digest; `thebearcave` submodule-bump PRs automated.
- Catalog CI: schema validation + retired-registry cross-check + image-tag freshness report (weekly scheduled).

## 9. Rollout (ordered, each step mergeable)

1. **M0 — Skeleton**: repo, Rust+React skeleton, compose service, dashboard read-only (containers, health, mount) — old interfaces still live.
2. **M1 — Read parity**: queues, stats, logs, activity feed, host diagnostics. (All read-only.)
3. **M2 — Env & credentials**: env editor + apply engine, credentials panel with tests, guard #4 live.
4. **M3 — Mutations**: container lifecycle, Plex suite, unstick UI, prunes, nzbdav safe-recreate.
5. **M4 — Catalog**: 100-entry catalog research PR (user reviews), install/uninstall PR flow.
6. **M5 — Lists & watchable**: Letterboxd/MDBList/loop-ratings ports, checkpoints.
7. **M6 — Notifications & digest**: Discord + Gmail SMTP + scheduler.
8. **M7 — Removal**: the §2 inventory PR(s) in `thebearcave` (functions, fish, waybar, TUI, registry, submodule unpinned, CI checks) — the "full removal" commit.
9. **M8 — Polish**: theme presets beyond default, mobile passes, performance budgets.

**Definition of done (v1):** every §6 feature live; §2 inventory deleted; `tests/health/run-all.sh` extended with a cave-deck check; the stack runs one full week with zero terminal commands needed for any operation the GUI covers.

## 10. Acceptance checklist (extract)

- [ ] Every function row in **Appendix C** resolves to a GUI feature ID (or carries an explicit `retire:` marker); the cave-deck repo exports Appendix C as `parity/parity.yaml` and CI fails on any row whose feature ID is not implemented
- [ ] Env write → prompted apply → guarded recreate cascade demonstrable end-to-end
- [ ] Catalog install of a new container produces: PR → CI green → merge → healthy service, no manual terminal steps
- [ ] Retired-service names cannot appear in the catalog (CI-enforced)
- [ ] nzbdav recreate blocked while queue non-empty (red path test)
- [ ] Secret values masked; reveal audit-logged
- [ ] Digest email arrives from Gmail app-password relay; Discord embeds post

## 11. Open questions (non-blocking, decide during implementation)

1. Port 7780 confirmation (or another free port) at M0.
2. Whether `thebearcave`'s remaining CI-only Python scripts absorb any Cave-Deck-style checks later.
3. Exact Discord event taxonomy (which events post vs stay in-app) — default: failures + guard trips + job completions + digest only.
4. Digest default cadence (daily vs weekly) — default weekly.
5. Whether the host shim ships as part of cave-deck repo (Rust, `cargo build`) or a tiny separate binary — default: same repo, `/host-shim`.

# Appendix A — Catalog schema & validation rules

This appendix is the normative definition of `cave-deck` repo file `catalog/catalog.yaml`. CI enforces every rule below; the GUI's install form is generated from the same schema.

## A.1 File structure

```yaml
version: 1                  # schema version; bump = breaking change to entries
updated: 2026-09-06         # last review date (CI warns if > 90 days)
entries: [ ... ]            # exactly 100 entries in v1
```

## A.2 Entry schema (authoritative fields)

| Field | Type | Req | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | ✅ | `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`; **globally unique**; used as compose service name + config dir name |
| `name` | string | ✅ | Human name; **must not** contain a retired-registry token (§A.4) |
| `category` | enum | ✅ | `media` \| `ops` \| `network` \| `home` |
| `retired` | bool | ✅ | Must be `false` (retired names never ship — §A.4); field exists so a future de-listing is data, not schema |
| `image` | string | ✅ | `registry/repo:tag`; tag required (no bare repo); `:latest` allowed only with `digest_pin: recommended` note |
| `digest` | string | – | `sha256:...` when the image is pinned; CI freshness job flags entries whose tag moved > 30 days |
| `ports` | list | – | `"HOST:CONTAINER[/proto]"`, proto `tcp` default; HOST 1–65535; **unique per (host port, protocol) pair across the whole catalog** — tcp and udp may share a host port (catches collisions at curation time, not install time) |
| `volumes` | list | – | `"SRC:DST[:mode]"`; SRC absolute or `./`-relative (repo-relative in thebearcave); DST absolute; modes `ro` allowed; **DST collisions within one entry are an error** |
| `env` | list | – | `{key, default?, secret?, description?}`; KEY `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` (Docker's env-name rule — **case-sensitive**, so Pi-hole v6's lowercase `FTLCONF_webserver_api_password` is valid); `secret: true` entries **must not** ship a `default` (the GUI prompts and writes `secrets/`) |
| `capabilities` | list | – | Docker caps to add (`NET_ADMIN`, `SYS_ADMIN`, ...); **non-empty requires `notes` justification** |
| `host_network` | bool | – | default `false`; `true` requires `notes` justification (stack precedent: Plex only) |
| `pid_mode` | string | – | default unset; `host` shares the host PID namespace (process visibility — e.g. Glances); requires `notes` justification |
| `devices` | list | – | e.g. `/dev/dri`, `/dev/net/tun`; requires `notes` |
| `dependencies` | list | – | Other catalog `id`s this entry requires (e.g. paperless → redis); install flow offers to add them together |
| `mem_limit` | string | ✅ | e.g. `512m`; values above `2g` require `notes` (host budget: 22 GiB) |
| `healthcheck` | string | – | CMD-SHELL test; entries with a web UI should ship one |
| `docs` | string (URL) | ✅ | Upstream install docs the entry was verified against |
| `notes` | string | – | Install gotchas, post-install steps, stack-specific warnings |
| `compose_fragment` | string (YAML) | – | **Optional override.** By default the renderer generates the service block from the fields above (`<<: *common` anchor prepended, `container_name = id`, `restart: unless-stopped`, networks `[bearcave]`). Only special cases (host network, caps, custom sysctls) ship a fragment; the fragment must still satisfy §A.5 |

## A.3 Reserved names

`id` must not collide with: the 8 always-on services (`prowlarr, radarr, sonarr, nzbdav, nzbdav-rclone, seerr, plex, unpackerr`), the maintenance profile (`imagemaid, recyclarr`), or `cave-deck`.

## A.4 Retired-registry cross-check (CI-enforced)

- `catalog/retired-registry.lock` is a **synced copy** of `RETIRED_SERVICES` from `thebearcave/scripts/audit_residue.py` (currently: traefik, loki, promtail, grafana, prometheus, alertmanager, node-exporter, cadvisor, nzbdav-exporter, arr-dashboard, landing-page, metacache, lidarr, readarr, audiobookshelf, komga, adguard, crowdsec, vaultwarden, watchstate, cleanuparr, uptime-kuma, n8n, control-panel, bazarr).
- A nightly CI job fetches `audit_residue.py` from `thebearcave@main` and fails if the lock drifted (new retirement ⇒ the catalog entry disappears same day).
- **Check:** for every entry, `id`, `name` (lowercased, non-alphanumerics stripped), and every path token of `image`'s repo are matched against the registry. Any hit ⇒ CI fails. **Substring risk is accepted and mitigated** by word-boundary matching (e.g. `bazarr` must not match a hypothetical `subbazarrx`; but an entry named *Bazarr Reloaded* does fail — curation avoids family names entirely).
- The install flow re-runs the same check at GUI runtime (defense in depth) so a stale lock can't leak a retired service into a live PR.

## A.5 Generated/overridden compose fragment rules

A fragment (generated or shipped) is valid only if it:
1. has exactly one top-level key = `id`;
2. includes `<<: *common` as its first key;
3. sets `container_name: <id>`, `mem_limit`, `networks: [bearcave]` (unless `host_network: true`, then `network_mode: host` and **no** `ports:`);
4. declares no `depends_on` on services outside the stack + catalog `dependencies`;
5. binds no host port already published in `thebearcave`'s compose (renderer checks live + file); 
6. mounts nothing outside `./config/<id>`, `./media/*`, and declared `volumes`.

## A.6 CI pipeline (catalog)

| Job | When | Fails on |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | every PR | YAML/schema violations, duplicate `id`/ports, missing fields |
| `retired-check` | every PR + nightly | any §A.4 hit; lock drift vs thebearcave |
| `count` | every PR | entries ≠ 100 (v1) |
| `freshness` | weekly | image tags > 30 days behind upstream, digests stale |
| `render` | every PR | fragment generation fails / §A.5 violations |

# Appendix B — Seed catalog (26 verified entries)

Proves the schema against real containers. Categories per §6.3 target mix. All images verified current as of 2026-09-06 (rebrand-sensitive paths checked: Kometa, wg-easy v15, Pi-hole v6 env vars). **Deliberately absent:** every retired-registry name (no AdGuard, no Uptime Kuma, no Vaultwarden, no Grafana/Prometheus stack, no Lidarr/Readarr/Audiobookshelf/Komga, no torrent clients — Usenet-only stack policy).

### Port budget in the seed set (conflict-free by construction)

Where upstream defaults collided (8080×4, 5055, 80/443) the host side was shifted and the entry's `notes` says so — the install form pre-fills these and conflict detection re-verifies at deploy time.

# Appendix C — Function→GUI parity table (authoritative)

This appendix enumerates **every operational function** being retired and maps it to the Cave Deck feature that replaces it. Feature IDs are dotted lowercase (`area.name`) and resolve to §6 sections. Sources:

| Source | Count | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `thebearcave/services/bash-functions/functions/*.sh` | **105** | The active operational surface (`stack-*`) |
| `thebearcave/services/bash-functions/waybar/scripts/stack-tui-toggle.sh` | 1 | Waybar/TUI-internal helper (`stack_windows_json`) — retires with the TUI |
| Cave-Scripts submodule `cave-sys-*` / `cave-btrfs-*` / `cave-backup` (bash) | 32 | Host-layer operations (19 safe `sys` + 2 mutating `pkg` + 7 `btrfs` + 1 `backup` + 12 `de`) |
| Cave-Scripts fish `services/host-tools/functions/*.fish` | 23 | Legacy host mirrors of the `cave-sys-*` set + 2 fish-only extras |

**Reconciliation of the "~110 bash + 25 fish" estimate:** the live count is 105 `stack-*` functions (+1 waybar helper). The Cave-Scripts registry (`tests/live/safe_command_registry.yaml`) classifies **68 safe / 72 excluded command surfaces** across `cave-*` mirrors and host families; mirrors collapse onto the same operations as the `stack-*` table below. The fish layer is a legacy mirror of the host families plus two fish-only operations (`flatpak-updates`, `claude-home`), which are folded into the host table. **Unique in-scope operations: 140** (105 stack + 21 sys + 11 btrfs + 1 backup + 2 fish-only); the 12 `de` (desktop-environment) functions are explicitly retired without GUI equivalents.

**Safety-class legend** (from the live-harness registry where registered): `RO` = read-only; `MS` = mutating-safe; `EXC` = excluded from the automated live matrix (mutating / destructive-confirm / heavy) — every `EXC` row ships in the GUI behind a two-step confirm or as a job.

## C.3 Internal helpers (no GUI surface — absorbed into the backend)

`__stack_curl`, `__arr_api`, `__arr_api_url`, `__arr_api_key`, `__stack_arr_app`, `__plex_api`, `__plex_butler`, `__seerr_api`, `__nzbdav_api`, `__stack_containers`, `__stack_metadata` (bash), `__host_helper`, `__host_containers` (fish), `stack_windows_json` (waybar), `fmt_*` formatters, `gen-bash-completions.sh`, `stack-completions.sh`, `__bearcave_warn_stale_keys`. These are transport/format plumbing: their behavior becomes the Rust backend's HTTP/WS handlers and shared clients (§4.1), not UI features.

## C.4 Enforcement rule

The cave-deck repo exports this appendix as `parity/parity.yaml` (function → feature ID → safety class). CI fails when: (a) a row's feature ID has no implemented route/page, (b) an `EXC` row's GUI path lacks its two-step confirm/job wrapper, or (c) a row disappears without a matching removal note. thebearcave's `audit_residue.py` continues to fail on any surviving `stack-*` reference after the removal PR (§9 M9).

# Appendix D — Rust backend API surface (REST + WebSocket)

Normative contract for the axum backend (§3.2). Generated from and cross-checked against Appendix C's feature IDs: **every route is tagged with the feature IDs it serves, and every feature ID must be served by at least one route** (D.4) — CI in the cave-deck repo enforces both directions against `parity/parity.yaml`.

## D.1 Conventions

- Base URL `http://<host-ip>:7780/api/v1/`; JSON bodies; no auth (LAN trust, §3.4).
- **Errors:** non-2xx ⇒ `{"error": {"code": "queue_not_empty", "message": "…", "detail": {…}}}` with stable snake_case codes; never HTML.
- **Pagination:** list routes accept `?page&pageSize` (default 50, max 500) ⇒ `{"data": [...], "page": 1, "pageSize": 50, "total": 1234}`.
- **Mutations are jobs:** destructive/mutating POSTs return `202 {"jobId": "…"}` and progress over WS topic `jobs` (§5.2). Only trivial state flips return `204`.
- **Confirm tokens:** every `EXC`-class operation (Appendix C safety) **requires** `"confirm": "<target-id>"` in the body, matching what the UI's two-step dialog shows. Mismatch ⇒ `422 code=confirm_required`. This ports the live-harness registry's exclusion semantics into the API layer.
- **Audit:** middleware records `(actor_ip, action, target, params, job_id)` for every POST/PUT/DELETE before dispatch (§5.4 `audit`).
- **OpenAPI:** utoipa serves `/api/docs` (UI) and `/api/v1/openapi.json`; the frontend's typed client is generated from it (§3.3).

## D.3 WebSocket endpoints

`ws://<host-ip>:7780/api/v1/ws` — single socket, multiplexed by topic. Client sends `{"sub":["topic",…]}` / `{"unsub":[…]}`; server answers each topic with a `snapshot` frame then deltas; heartbeat ping 10s; origin-checked (§3.4).

| Topic | Frame shape | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `docker.stats` | 1s per-container deltas | `dash.overview` |
| `docker.events` | die/stop/oom/health_status | `ctnr.lifecycle` `dash.feed` |
| `queue.arr` | merged queue diffs | `stick.queue` `dash.rows` |
| `queue.nzbdav` | download queue + speeds | `nzbd.queue` |
| `mount.health` | 10s mountpoint + VFS | `nzbd.mount` |
| `plex.sessions` | on change | `plex.sessions` |
| `system.host` | 10s mem/disk/load | `host.mem` `host.disk` |
| `jobs` | state transitions + progress | all mutating flows |
| `logs.<container>` | live tail (`level=` filter param in sub) | `ctnr.lifecycle` `lib.health` |
| `deploy.status` | catalog PR/install step events | catalog |

## D.4 Feature-ID coverage matrix

Every Appendix C feature ID must appear here. (Compact form: `ID → primary routes → WS topics`.) CI asserts both directions: matrix ⊆ routes, and Appendix C's mapped IDs ⊆ matrix. `retire:` rows (`UI-native`, `DE-layer`) assert **no** routes on purpose — a route serving them is a CI error.

| Feature ID | Routes | WS topics |
|---|---|---|
| `dash.overview` | dashboard, version, containers/{id}/stats, metrics | docker.stats, docker.events, system.host |

## D.5 Shim command surface (host systemd helper)

The backend reaches the shim over a **localhost-only Unix socket** with a fixed, auditable command allowlist (§3.1) — no general shell. Each command maps 1:1 to a host route above: `journal.query`, `services.failed`, `pkg.{updates,orphans,history,update,clean,flatpak,aur}`, `btrfs.{usage,subvols,devstats,scrub.status,balance.status,qgroup,snapper,snapshot.create,snapshot.delete,subvol.create,scrub.start,balance.start}`, `smart.query`, `reboot.{required,kernel}`, `cron.list`, `git.status`, `ufw.status`, `ufw.allow`, `ssh.doctor`, `path.{read,list}` (constrained roots), `backup.{run,restore}`. Every invocation is logged to the audit trail; mutating shim commands additionally require the confirm-token header from D.1.

## D.6 API-layer enforcement (cave-deck CI)

1. `openapi` job: utoipa spec builds; generated TS client compiles (no drift).
2. `feature-coverage` job: parses Appendix C's `parity/parity.yaml` + the route table's feature-ID tags; fails on unmapped IDs, unserved IDs, or any route tagged with a `retire:` row.
3. `safety` job: every route whose feature-ID rows are `EXC`-class must declare `confirm` in its handler metadata and a `202`-job return type; destructive-confirm rows must additionally name the shim/job wrapper used.
4. `guard` job: the `plex/empty-trash`, `env/apply`, and `nzbdav/recreate` handlers must reference the landmine guards (#2, #4, #13) in their integration tests — the red-path tests from §7 are pinned to these routes.
